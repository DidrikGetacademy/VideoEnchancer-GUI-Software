[0.00s - 5.52s] You're not stuck. You're actually grieving a past version of yourself.
[5.52s - 12.80s] There's an identity, an idea, a mindset, a behavior, an attitude that is keeping you held back.
[12.80s - 17.76s] So reality has moved on, but you've held on and that's what's keeping you stuck.
[17.76s - 23.28s] And once you let go of that, once you open and release your hands, all of a sudden you feel free.
[24.00s - 26.64s] I am just blown away.
[27.44s - 28.88s] You can hate where you're at.
[28.88s - 29.28s] Yes.
[29.28s - 32.88s] And still gain all the skills you need for your future.
[33.44s - 39.60s] That mindset shift is how do I turn a place of misery and pain and potentially suffering
[40.16s - 42.80s] into a place that becomes the launchpad of my life.
[42.80s - 45.60s] This is the place where I take off from.
[45.60s - 49.60s] When you're feeling stuck, you might not be able to change what's around you.
[49.60s - 51.44s] So change how you view it.
[51.44s - 56.16s] There is no rose in the world that grows the day you plant the seed.
[56.72s - 64.64s] It takes months, sometimes even years for a tree to have a beautiful fruit or a beautiful flower.
[65.20s - 69.92s] If you're feeling like you're caught in a spiral of the same thing after the same thing,
[70.72s - 72.32s] life is trying to teach you something.
[73.44s - 75.04s] Go to the school of life.
[75.04s - 79.28s] Jay, I think when things feel dark, the job in life is to glow.
[79.92s - 82.80s] And you've definitely taught me how to do that.
