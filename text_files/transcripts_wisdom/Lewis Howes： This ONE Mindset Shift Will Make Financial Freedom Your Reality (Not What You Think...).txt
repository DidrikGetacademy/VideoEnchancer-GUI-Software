[0.00s - 2.40s] Irrelevant of whether you have money or not.
[2.40s - 5.28s] When you are poor, when you're broke, when you're struggling financially,
[5.28s - 8.88s] it feels really hard to feel abundant and rich.
[8.88s - 12.48s] But in order to get out of it, it's not feeling worse about it.
[12.48s - 17.76s] It's starting to feel better about me, better about my values, my character, my kindness,
[17.76s - 21.68s] my generosity, and seeing how can I add value to others?
[21.68s - 28.00s] How can I get into a richness inside of me to serve and take care of me at the same time?

[32.00s - 36.56s] C1.
[36.56s - 40.24s] The world in which we're living today doesn't seem to distribute wealth
[40.80s - 43.68s] in a way that allows people to access it.
[43.68s - 45.52s] Some people have been set up really badly.
[45.52s - 47.84s] They had poor access to education.
[48.40s - 50.80s] They didn't really know what jobs were available.
[50.80s - 54.32s] People are working really, really hard and not taking that much home.
[54.32s - 59.28s] People are coming at it from a place of pain, of desperation, of stress.
[59.36s - 61.44s] Everyone already knows that money is stressful.
[62.16s - 64.88s] Your first point here is make money easy.
[65.44s - 68.96s] And so I want to ask you, when someone's coming at money,
[68.96s - 72.96s] our relationship with money is already at a place kind of like finding love.
[72.96s - 74.56s] We're desperate for it.
[74.56s - 76.16s] We're stressed by it.
[76.16s - 77.36s] We're paralyzed by it.
[77.36s - 79.20s] We feel the pressure for it.
[79.20s - 81.36s] What do you do when you're feeling all of that?
[81.36s - 83.28s] What's the first thing you need to do?
[83.28s - 84.80s] Step one is you need awareness.
[84.80s - 88.64s] And again, you probably say this so often and people probably heard this so frequently.
[88.64s - 93.92s] But if you don't have awareness on your attachment style towards money
[93.92s - 98.64s] and how your nervous system is when you receive money or when money leaves you,
[98.64s - 101.20s] when you have to pay your bills or give money away,
[102.00s - 107.04s] I want people to create just a scenario of awareness around how you feel
[107.04s - 110.96s] and how you think when you receive money, when you pay money,
[110.96s - 114.24s] when you look at your bank account, when you open your purse or your wallet
[114.24s - 116.24s] and just notice how do I feel?
[116.88s - 118.64s] Do I have shallow breathing?
[118.64s - 119.92s] Do I feel relaxed?
[119.92s - 121.12s] Do I feel anxious?
[121.12s - 122.48s] Do I feel scarce?
[122.48s - 123.92s] Do I feel abundant?
[123.92s - 130.72s] Just step one is have awareness on how do I feel and how do I think about my money?
[130.72s - 134.48s] The money I have, the money that's coming in and the money that's going out.
[134.48s - 135.60s] That's step one.
[135.60s - 138.16s] And when you can just have awareness around it,
[138.16s - 142.24s] you can start to say, is my relationship the one that I want to be having?
[142.24s - 144.96s] Do I feel really secure around money?
[144.96s - 148.24s] If not, okay, what's something I can think about?
[148.24s - 153.68s] First, let me think about my money story, the story of my life around money.
[153.68s - 159.92s] We grow up as kids and we watch our parents in their relationship.
[159.92s - 163.12s] We tend to develop the relationship style of our parents
[163.12s - 167.28s] unless we learn how to heal as a teenager and have some type of breakthrough.
[167.28s - 170.88s] We're creating some type of attachment style based on what we see with our parents.
[170.88s - 174.24s] But think about all the conversations your parents had around money.
[174.24s - 177.68s] And if your parents didn't have a secure relationship, if they fought,
[177.68s - 179.20s] did they fight about money?
[179.20s - 182.96s] Were you involved in the conversation about how expensive things were?
[182.96s - 187.12s] About your school or sports or programs that they had to pay for they couldn't afford?
[187.12s - 188.08s] Did they argue?
[188.08s - 189.84s] Did they have challenges?
[189.84s - 190.96s] Did they get divorced?
[191.76s - 193.76s] Money is one of the biggest reasons people get divorced.
[193.76s - 196.64s] It's one of the biggest arguments in marriage as well.
[196.64s - 202.00s] So just notice, is my nervous system, is my body, is my energy or my thoughts
[202.00s - 203.28s] stressed out around money?
[203.28s - 206.64s] Do I feel scarce or do I feel abundant?
[207.44s - 211.52s] That's kind of step one and then step two is understanding your money's story.
[211.52s - 214.16s] Because when you can reflect on your money's story,
[214.16s - 216.96s] you can see what your money personality style is today.
[217.60s - 221.68s] And for many years, and we can talk about both of us thinking about our past,
[221.68s - 226.24s] for many years, I didn't understand money growing up.
[226.24s - 227.84s] We didn't have a lot growing up.
[227.84s - 233.04s] We weren't completely poor, but I wasn't as well off as the other kids in my class.
[233.04s - 235.36s] So I always felt a little bit beneath everyone else.
[235.36s - 237.28s] And so my belief system was around that.
[237.28s - 238.88s] I'm just a little bit under everyone else.
[238.88s - 240.48s] Everyone else is doing a little bit better than us.
[241.20s - 245.12s] Sure, we have a home and I'm going to school, but everyone's got rollerblades.
[245.12s - 246.08s] I'm in sneakers.
[246.08s - 247.20s] People have Nintendo.
[247.20s - 247.92s] I don't have one.
[247.92s - 249.36s] I'm reading a book, whatever it is.
[249.36s - 250.88s] It was like I was a little bit beneath.
[250.88s - 253.60s] And that started to shape my story, my personality style.
[253.60s - 255.92s] So I felt very insecure around money.
[256.48s - 260.00s] And when I got it, I got really excited, but I didn't know what to do with it.
[260.00s - 261.84s] So I was also like afraid.
[261.84s - 264.16s] I was insecure and I was just unsure of it.
[264.88s - 268.00s] And it really started to shape my personality style.
[268.00s - 271.12s] Now when I was in my teen years, my dad started to make more money
[271.12s - 272.72s] and started to teach me a little bit.
[272.72s - 275.44s] But I was still like just, I want to be a teenager.
[275.44s - 276.64s] I don't want to think about this stuff.
[276.64s - 277.92s] It seems confusing.
[277.92s - 278.80s] I just want to have fun.
[279.73s - 285.89s] In my 20s, when I got done playing football, I went to go pursue football,
[285.89s - 286.61s] got injured.
[286.61s - 289.49s] I was on my sister's couch for a year and a half and I had no money.
[289.97s - 293.01s] And I just felt like, how am I going to make this work?
[293.01s - 293.97s] How am I going to make money?
[293.97s - 295.17s] I don't know what my skills are.
[295.17s - 296.69s] I don't know what my talents are.
[296.69s - 299.25s] This is in 2008 when the economy was crashing.
[299.25s - 303.33s] So it kind of felt like it is right now with inflation going up so much right now
[303.33s - 305.65s] and people worried about money in the future.
[305.65s - 306.93s] I didn't understand.
[307.57s - 311.57s] And I needed to find money mentors to start teaching me
[311.57s - 316.37s] how to learn about how I can receive money and spend it in a more efficient way.
[316.93s - 319.41s] And that was kind of the journey of me starting to figure this out.
[319.41s - 323.41s] But if we don't have the tools or the money knowledge,
[323.41s - 327.89s] then we're always going to be stuck in our money story as our money personality style.
[327.89s - 329.81s] And so it's getting to understand awareness.
[329.81s - 332.69s] How does it feel when I receive money and I spend money?
[333.73s - 336.29s] What is the history of the story around money for me?
[336.29s - 337.33s] Did my parents fight?
[337.33s - 339.01s] Did I feel anxious around money?
[339.89s - 341.81s] I used to steal a lot when I was a kid.
[341.81s - 344.37s] So I had like some wounds around money.
[344.37s - 346.21s] I had people steal from me as well.
[346.21s - 349.89s] So I just had all these different wounds that I had to address and get clear on.
[350.61s - 353.97s] And I had to learn how to start healing those money wounds.
[353.97s - 357.01s] And again, I know this is the place to come to create more wholeness,
[357.01s - 359.73s] to be healthier in your life and to become more healed.
[359.73s - 362.93s] And that's what I want for people is to start to reflect on their money story.
[363.73s - 366.77s] Write down some of these things so you have awareness first off
[366.77s - 370.13s] on why you think and feel the way you do around money.
[370.13s - 374.37s] Then you can start to see how your personality style towards money now
[374.37s - 379.01s] is either helping you create more abundance or keeping you in scarcity and lack.
[379.01s - 381.49s] And from there, we can start to have some breakthroughs.
[381.49s - 385.41s] Yeah, let's talk about all three because as I'm listening to you,
[385.41s - 389.55s] I'm thinking that for most of us, when we get aware,
[389.55s - 393.87s] we actually realize we don't even want to look at our finances.
[394.51s - 397.79s] That's how we all feel because we're so scared.
[397.79s - 401.63s] And there's been such a fear built around money that it's like,
[401.63s - 404.43s] I don't even want to know because I'm so scared.
[404.43s - 407.71s] Now, when I get my paycheck, I'm thinking, oh, God, I hope this covers
[408.27s - 411.87s] my rent, my groceries, my bills, whatever else I've got to cover.
[411.87s - 414.03s] And then that becomes your stress point.
[414.03s - 417.15s] And then you're thinking, oh, gosh, I haven't got enough to spend on this thing
[417.15s - 421.15s] that I really wanted to do or I wanted to do something for my kids or whatever it may be.
[421.15s - 422.43s] So now there's stress.
[422.43s - 425.15s] And so I think for most people, when you actually get aware of this,
[425.15s - 426.91s] you start realizing it's stress.
[427.47s - 428.51s] And it's never enough.
[428.51s - 429.23s] And it's never enough.
[429.23s - 430.35s] I'm never making enough.
[430.35s - 433.47s] And also, I've got 100,000 in student loan debt.
[433.47s - 435.87s] I have this other credit card because I wanted to go on a trip
[435.87s - 438.91s] or I had a medical expense that was unexpected that came up.
[439.71s - 443.47s] So many people are struggling to be figuring out how to get out of debt.
[443.47s - 446.19s] They have this weight that's carrying them back,
[446.19s - 449.95s] but they still want to feel like they're free to live a life of their dreams.
[449.95s - 452.27s] They want to be able to go on a trip with a friend a few times a year.
[452.27s - 453.95s] They want to go to those expensive concerts.
[453.95s - 457.95s] They want to have fun still, but they're unfortunately in a lot of debt.
[457.95s - 460.91s] So there's something that's pulling them back as they're trying to go forward.
[460.91s - 463.47s] And they feel like there's no way to break free.
[463.47s - 467.23s] They think about the rising costs of eggs, the inflation,
[467.87s - 469.07s] how everything is just constant.
[469.07s - 470.51s] You can't afford a home anymore.
[470.51s - 473.31s] All these things seem impossible to break through.
[473.95s - 478.11s] But people want to feel free, but they don't feel emotionally free
[478.11s - 480.03s] because of all the baggage they have in their life.
[480.67s - 485.71s] And that's what I want people to start to feel is how can you feel emotionally free
[486.67s - 490.35s] so that your money can come to you effortlessly?
[490.35s - 492.75s] And when it leaves you, it's not a bad thing.
[493.31s - 495.47s] And the more we relax, the more we can receive.
[496.03s - 498.43s] And so if I'm tight and I'm always anxious,
[498.43s - 501.79s] or I'm not willing to look at my bank account because I'm afraid of what's in there,
[502.67s - 507.15s] how are we able to receive more and spend more freely?
[507.15s - 511.47s] And I think for many years, I was able to, I learned how to make money,
[512.19s - 514.19s] but I didn't learn how to spend money.
[514.27s - 518.11s] And so I just hoarded it because I was afraid to go back being broke on my sister's couch.
[518.11s - 519.55s] I didn't want to go be broke again.
[519.55s - 522.27s] So I just stashed it away into my bank account and just like,
[522.27s - 525.55s] okay, I'm going to just wait for it to grow so I feel safe.
[526.11s - 528.91s] But that was almost like a prison in a sense emotionally
[528.91s - 530.59s] because I didn't feel free to spend it.
[530.59s - 532.43s] I was still sleeping on friends' couches.
[532.99s - 535.87s] I had a million dollars in the bank and I was sleeping on friends' couches.
[535.87s - 541.07s] I was sitting in the middle seat, the cheapest seat I could on buses or on planes.
[541.07s - 543.79s] And I'd always be like, man, I'm so uncomfortable the next day.
[544.51s - 545.39s] My back hurts.
[546.43s - 549.39s] I'm not feeling free because I was afraid.
[549.39s - 551.15s] I was anxious to lose money.
[551.71s - 553.55s] And that is not emotional freedom.
[553.55s - 554.99s] That is not healing.
[555.55s - 559.31s] And I remember thinking to myself, God, I'm starting to make money.
[559.31s - 564.59s] It was like years into my business, I was like, I'm financially free, but I'm still trapped.
[565.39s - 566.43s] What is holding me back?
[566.43s - 570.11s] And I realized a lot of it was my money story and my money personality style
[570.11s - 571.71s] that I needed to start working on.
[571.71s - 574.99s] And I don't know if it's the thing that you ever like, I've arrived and I'm perfect
[574.99s - 577.15s] and now I'm like this Zen master at money.
[577.71s - 579.71s] It's a constant back to awareness.
[579.71s - 583.87s] It's a constant practice of awareness and breaking through those limitations.
[583.87s - 584.11s] Yeah.
[584.11s - 585.95s] I think what I'm thinking about when I'm hearing you is
[586.51s - 592.03s] if me and you went back to a place in our life where we really didn't have money.
[592.03s - 592.75s] Yes.
[592.75s - 595.95s] And you think about someone who's in that position who's listening to us right now
[596.83s - 601.15s] and in their head they're thinking, but how do I become abundant?
[601.95s - 606.99s] When I don't have, my natural thing is like, I'm just struggling to pay my next bill.
[606.99s - 608.91s] And me and you have both been in those situations.
[608.91s - 613.71s] I remember when I was growing up, I grew up in a house where we had just enough.
[614.27s - 616.19s] Like that was the language my parents used.
[616.19s - 617.23s] We have just enough.
[617.87s - 620.59s] And my parents would often argue about money.
[620.59s - 622.99s] I remember I wasn't allowed to buy cool shoes and stuff.
[622.99s - 626.11s] I'd have like the knockoff cheapest brand from whatever, which was,
[626.11s - 627.63s] I actually didn't have an issue with that.
[627.63s - 631.55s] I didn't have an issue with any of it because we had food and that was my normality.
[631.87s - 634.35s] But it's really interesting because the amount of times growing up,
[634.91s - 636.43s] I started working when I was 14.
[637.47s - 644.11s] And I think that gave me a really interesting sense of how hard it was to make money.
[644.11s - 645.55s] Because I started working at 14.
[645.55s - 650.91s] I used to get paid two pounds per street that I delivered newspapers on.
[650.91s - 652.99s] So imagine there's a hundred houses.
[652.99s - 654.11s] It's going to take me like...
[654.11s - 655.23s] Not per house.
[655.23s - 656.11s] No, no, no. Per street.
[656.11s - 656.83s] Per street.
[656.83s - 656.99s] Oh my gosh.
[656.99s - 658.51s] So I did five streets.
[658.51s - 660.83s] And so I'd get 10 pounds at the end of the week.
[660.83s - 662.19s] If I did five streets.
[662.19s - 666.75s] And each street would take me at least an hour, maybe, I don't know, something like that.
[666.75s - 670.75s] And so I'd walk around, I'd pull this thing and I'd deliver it.
[670.75s - 674.03s] And I got an understanding of how hard it was to make money.
[674.83s - 677.87s] But then that became a story for me going to your point.
[677.87s - 678.83s] Making money is hard.
[678.83s - 679.95s] Making money is hard.
[680.83s - 685.79s] And that there's only a certain amount of money you're allowed to make at this level.
[685.79s - 686.99s] Like you're a 14 year old.
[686.99s - 688.03s] Then I worked in retail.
[688.03s - 690.27s] I stacked shelves at a grocery store.
[690.27s - 693.31s] I worked at a store called Morrison's, which is like working at Walmart.
[694.03s - 697.63s] And there I remember I got paid like five pounds an hour.
[698.19s - 701.63s] And then you get like time and a half if you work the weekends and the evenings.
[702.35s - 708.27s] All of this to say that I probably spent my whole life only seeing zero in my bank account.
[708.27s - 711.55s] Because everything that would come in would pay for my phone bill,
[711.55s - 715.31s] my car insurance that I paid for, whatever it was that I was taking care of.
[715.31s - 718.83s] So I wasn't relying on my parents, apart from I lived in their home, obviously.
[719.63s - 721.63s] But I always felt like money came in, money went out.
[722.27s - 727.95s] And my story around money was people who have money are doing something bad.
[728.59s - 729.79s] So I lived in a home.
[729.79s - 733.31s] Whenever we went to a friend's home and they had a nice home,
[733.31s - 736.99s] my family would always say, oh yeah, but they do dodgy stuff to make money.
[736.99s - 740.43s] All the language around money was people with money are doing bad stuff.
[740.43s - 744.67s] So in my head it was like, oh, if you have money, then you must be doing shady stuff
[744.67s - 746.43s] because we don't have money and we're not doing any.
[746.91s - 748.75s] You must be hurting people to make money.
[748.75s - 750.35s] Correct. In some way, exploiting.
[750.35s - 751.15s] Taking advantage of.
[751.15s - 752.51s] Yeah, taking advantage, whatever.
[753.07s - 757.71s] So everything you're saying is so true because then when I got to a point in my life where
[757.71s - 764.19s] I was just trying to do good and I had something like 150, 200 million views on content.
[764.19s - 764.91s] And you had no money.
[764.91s - 766.43s] I was four months away from being grown.
[766.43s - 767.07s] I met you at this time.
[767.07s - 768.51s] And I met you around this time.
[768.51s - 769.47s] I met you at this time, yes.
[769.47s - 773.31s] And it was really interesting to me because that was the time
[773.95s - 776.67s] that I was actually doing this work, which is why this book is so powerful.
[776.67s - 782.27s] Because I realized that I couldn't, even with 150, 200 million views,
[782.27s - 789.15s] it wasn't that that made money because my story and my personality style was anxious.
[789.15s - 791.71s] I felt like it was wrong to make money.
[791.71s - 793.15s] Like that's actually what it was.
[793.15s - 794.83s] I felt like making money was bad.
[795.97s - 798.13s] And so until I got to that.
[798.13s - 800.69s] Did you believe you're worthy of making more money?
[800.69s - 805.81s] I believed I was worthy, but I believed that you had to be bad to make money.
[805.81s - 806.21s] Wow.
[806.21s - 807.25s] So you didn't want to be bad.
[807.25s - 811.65s] You don't want to have a lot of money and associate, I have a lot of money and now I'm bad.
[811.65s - 812.13s] Correct.
[812.13s - 815.09s] I'm bad and wrong and I'm hurting others in order to tell myself.
[815.09s - 815.33s] Correct.
[815.33s - 815.41s] Correct.
[815.41s - 816.61s] Because good people are poor.
[816.61s - 817.17s] Wow.
[817.17s - 817.33s] Right.
[817.33s - 820.93s] Like to be a good person of good character means to not have money.
[820.93s - 821.73s] Wow.
[821.73s - 824.61s] And that was based on a belief system that you developed.
[824.61s - 825.41s] Over time.
[825.41s - 825.57s] Yes.
[825.57s - 826.45s] That I didn't even know.
[826.45s - 829.33s] Like if you would have told me about this eight years ago, I would have been like,
[829.33s - 832.69s] I don't know, which is why I think these reflections are so important people.
[832.69s - 838.05s] If you're stressed, if you're overwhelmed, if you're anxious, if you're constantly in drama,
[838.05s - 839.25s] that is not abundance.
[839.97s - 843.89s] A high net worth does not mean you are free.
[843.89s - 850.61s] Money is an energy and how we think and how we feel will dictate the energy we have towards it.
[850.61s - 855.33s] When you have no money, when you're broke, when you feel stressed out, overwhelmed, burnt out,
[855.33s - 858.45s] you lost your job, you feel like you need help.
[858.93s - 860.05s] And you may need help.
[860.93s - 867.81s] And the best way to create abundance is to go from helplessness to helpfulness.
[868.45s - 871.73s] So when you're in that place, taking your story as well, taking my story,
[872.37s - 876.21s] how do we start to rewrite that story now that we're aware?
[876.21s - 877.41s] Well, so powerfully you said that.
[877.41s - 882.85s] And I remember this vividly because I met you on Halloween 2017, right?
[882.85s - 883.81s] Eight years ago, yeah.
[883.81s - 888.53s] And I said, cancel the day, let's just hang out all day.
[888.53s - 889.65s] Yeah, you had a book coming out that day.
[889.65s - 894.29s] I had a book that came out that day on Halloween, which is called The Baskin Baskin Linity.
[894.29s - 898.53s] Anyways, how do we rewire our brain around money to create more abundance?
[898.53s - 899.97s] When you have nothing.
[899.97s - 900.69s] When you have lack.
[900.69s - 904.45s] How do we rewire our brain to create abundance when you have nothing and you don't know how
[904.45s - 905.81s] to earn more money?
[905.81s - 911.41s] The first thing I think you need to be aware of is that your beliefs dictate your behaviors.
[911.41s - 919.25s] So if you believe that money is bad or people who make a lot of money are bad and take advantage
[919.25s - 924.29s] of others and therefore me having lack right now means I'm a good person and I don't want to
[924.29s - 928.21s] become a bad person, then that belief is going to dictate your behaviors and you're going to
[928.21s - 929.25s] stay in lack.
[929.25s - 933.41s] You're going to stay in scarcity and you're going to see opportunities that only give
[933.41s - 938.93s] you just enough as opposed to opportunities that could create incredible wealth for yourself
[938.93s - 942.37s] financially, but also an emotional wealth that you've never had before.
[943.09s - 947.49s] So that's one of the things you want to understand is first that your beliefs dictate your behaviors.
[947.49s - 948.45s] That's a big one by the way.
[948.45s - 949.25s] That's huge.
[949.25s - 949.65s] Like that.
[949.65s - 952.77s] I just want to point that out for people like that's so huge because your belief.
[952.77s - 953.41s] Yeah, it's huge.
[953.41s - 959.65s] Your belief got you to a place of I am impacting hundreds of millions of people from these videos
[959.65s - 963.41s] that I created with my talents, but I don't know how to make money with them.
[963.41s - 967.49s] And I don't know if I actually should because then I could be bad and wrong or people could
[967.49s - 971.65s] perceive me as I did something bad to make this money.
[971.65s - 973.33s] And I'm a spiritual person.
[973.33s - 974.05s] I'm a monk.
[974.05s - 975.33s] I've done all these things.
[975.33s - 979.57s] I don't want to have that life, but I want to make an impact and I don't want to be poor.
[979.57s - 982.29s] So I think a lot of people are struggling with that mindset.
[982.29s - 983.41s] What are the other ones you hear?
[983.41s - 985.49s] What are the other focusing on that belief?
[986.21s - 987.81s] What are you hearing from people about there?
[987.81s - 992.13s] But that's my belief and that's very much my history and story.
[992.13s - 994.85s] As you said, what other stuff do you hear from people?
[994.85s - 1001.49s] The biggest shift that will create abundance in your life is a mindset habit in unlocking
[1001.49s - 1002.77s] wealth for yourself.
[1002.77s - 1008.77s] And one of the big lies or one of the big blocks that holds people back from financial opportunity
[1009.41s - 1017.25s] is that I cannot be generous with my time, my wisdom, my knowledge, or my secrets to others.
[1017.25s - 1022.21s] Because if I am, they will take it and run with it and I will be left with nothing.
[1022.21s - 1024.29s] So therefore I'm going to hoard my energy.
[1024.29s - 1029.57s] I'm going to hoard my time, my knowledge, and only keep it to me so that others don't have
[1029.57s - 1031.65s] good ideas or have my help.
[1031.65s - 1036.53s] And from all the different billionaires and millionaires and financial leaders in the
[1036.53s - 1041.33s] world that I've interviewed, I know you've interviewed a lot of them, there is a question
[1041.33s - 1047.41s] I would always ask individuals who've made incredible amounts of money and that keeps
[1047.41s - 1049.73s] helping them create more wealth year after year.
[1050.37s - 1052.13s] And they all say the same thing.
[1052.13s - 1056.45s] Those who have had a sustainably good heart in the process is that you have to have a
[1056.45s - 1057.57s] generous mindset.
[1057.57s - 1061.89s] So the mindset habit is the first thing that you have to think about when creating abundance
[1061.89s - 1064.53s] with your money, but also feeling abundant internally.
[1065.33s - 1066.77s] And it's coming with generosity.
[1066.77s - 1070.69s] So if you feel like you're stuck right now, if you feel like you have nothing, this was
[1070.69s - 1072.85s] what you were at eight years ago when I met you.
[1072.85s - 1076.85s] This was where I was at 15 years ago when I was on my sister's couch.
[1076.85s - 1078.45s] I had no money.
[1078.53s - 1080.13s] I was in student loan debt.
[1080.13s - 1081.41s] I was sleeping on her couch.
[1081.97s - 1083.57s] I didn't think I had any skills.
[1083.57s - 1084.93s] I didn't have a college degree yet.
[1084.93s - 1088.21s] I was like, how am I going to make money if I don't know how to make money and I don't
[1088.21s - 1090.45s] have any talent or skill and I'm in debt?
[1090.45s - 1091.49s] It didn't understand it.
[1091.49s - 1092.85s] It felt impossible.
[1093.57s - 1098.29s] And the thing that I shifted when I started to meeting money mentors is I needed to learn
[1098.29s - 1103.17s] the first habit, which is the mindset habit, which is a habit of generosity and gratitude.
[1103.17s - 1104.37s] So what did that look like then?
[1104.37s - 1105.81s] What was the practical step?
[1105.81s - 1110.37s] What it looked like was how do I meet money people, people who have money, people who
[1110.37s - 1112.69s] have success, people who can teach me knowledge?
[1112.69s - 1118.05s] I needed to come with a sense of energy, of curiosity, of possibilities and of joy.
[1118.61s - 1122.69s] I literally wrote a list down of all these different things that I thought were my talents.
[1122.69s - 1123.81s] I go, how can I make money?
[1123.81s - 1125.49s] I don't have any skills.
[1125.49s - 1127.09s] I played football and now I'm injured.
[1127.09s - 1128.13s] What can I do for people?
[1128.69s - 1130.53s] But I was like, well, I'm really curious.
[1130.53s - 1132.21s] Maybe I can just ask people questions.
[1132.77s - 1138.05s] Never did I think in a million years that I could have a 12-year-old podcast just asking
[1138.05s - 1139.89s] questions and make millions of dollars a year.
[1139.89s - 1141.25s] I never thought that was possible.
[1141.89s - 1144.13s] I was in my early 20s and I was like, you know what?
[1144.13s - 1145.25s] I've got a lot of energy.
[1145.25s - 1146.69s] I've got a lot of passion.
[1146.69s - 1150.61s] So let me bring passion and energy to other people and excitement.
[1151.25s - 1153.17s] And that energy was infectious.
[1153.17s - 1158.21s] And there's a currency that's tied to that energy of passion, joy, excitement, curiosity.
[1158.77s - 1161.33s] That currency may not look like money,
[1161.33s - 1166.37s] but for those who are older, who have no more passion, they're burnt out, they're exhausted,
[1167.09s - 1169.17s] it is the highest form of currency.
[1169.17s - 1169.97s] They want that.
[1169.97s - 1171.73s] They crave that energy.
[1171.73s - 1174.13s] They've burnt themselves out for decades.
[1174.13s - 1175.25s] They want to feel young again.
[1175.25s - 1176.61s] They want to feel curious again.
[1176.61s - 1178.13s] They want to feel excited again.
[1178.13s - 1182.77s] And when you come to someone with that energy, you are bringing a different mindset.
[1182.77s - 1188.53s] So the mindset of curiosity, joy, passion, presence, like just connecting with someone
[1188.53s - 1192.77s] and asking them a question is such a valuable currency.
[1192.77s - 1197.65s] So we have to look into these untapped skills, talents, currency inside of us that
[1197.65s - 1201.65s] are hidden to others, but inside of us, they can create magic.
[1202.37s - 1203.09s] That's one of them.
[1203.09s - 1207.17s] Another one is just being generous with your time, with your resources,
[1207.81s - 1211.41s] with your ideas and helping others succeed.
[1211.41s - 1215.65s] I love that because I didn't even know that then, but I was doing it unconsciously.
[1215.65s - 1216.29s] Yes, you were.
[1216.29s - 1220.77s] So I really wanted to interview incredible people,
[1220.77s - 1223.97s] but I didn't have a platform at the time when I met you.
[1223.97s - 1225.65s] And so I'd partnered up with NASDAQ.
[1226.21s - 1229.41s] And by the way, just to be really clear with everyone, I didn't get paid to do this.
[1229.41s - 1233.01s] So NASDAQ had something where everyone was using Facebook Live,
[1233.01s - 1236.37s] and I said, hey, could I have an hour in the NASDAQ building
[1237.01s - 1242.21s] whenever I have an amazing guest that says yes, so that I can interview them on NASDAQ Live,
[1242.77s - 1246.69s] and they would put the picture up on the middle of Times Square.
[1246.69s - 1247.41s] On a billboard.
[1247.41s - 1249.57s] So now I could reach out to people I looked up to.
[1249.57s - 1250.93s] That's the reason why I went on the show.
[1250.93s - 1251.41s] Exactly.
[1251.41s - 1254.69s] I didn't know who you were until I saw, hey, I can get you on a billboard on Times Square.
[1254.69s - 1257.25s] I go, that's value to value right now.
[1257.25s - 1261.41s] I'm being generous, and I'm trying to find a way because I don't have anything to offer,
[1261.41s - 1262.29s] but I admire you.
[1262.29s - 1263.33s] And it was all people I admired.
[1263.33s - 1263.97s] It was yourself.
[1263.97s - 1265.65s] It was Ryan Holiday said yes.
[1265.65s - 1269.01s] Me and Ryan had met maybe once before that, but Ryan came on that show.
[1269.01s - 1270.69s] And there were a bunch of other authors.
[1270.69s - 1272.61s] Deepak Chopra came on that show with me.
[1272.61s - 1275.81s] And it was all people that I admired, looked up to for a long time.
[1276.45s - 1278.45s] And exactly that.
[1278.45s - 1280.69s] First of all, we became great friends off of it.
[1280.69s - 1286.21s] But the point is, it's exactly what you're saying that even though I felt I had nothing to offer,
[1286.21s - 1290.29s] I had to find a way to create something to offer someone of value.
[1290.29s - 1292.21s] I didn't get paid for it for that show.
[1292.21s - 1293.49s] I didn't get paid to run it.
[1293.49s - 1295.17s] I didn't make any money from it.
[1295.17s - 1298.13s] But it created an opportunity for me to connect with friends,
[1298.13s - 1301.01s] to connect with people that were doing incredible things.
[1301.01s - 1305.17s] And of course, allowed me to showcase my talents so that then I could show it to other people.
[1305.17s - 1309.49s] I remember I had Ryan Harwood on the show who founded PureWow.
[1310.13s - 1311.73s] And he just sold it to Gary Vee.
[1312.29s - 1313.65s] That's how I met Gary.
[1313.65s - 1317.01s] So Ryan came on my show and he was just like, Jay, I love you.
[1317.01s - 1317.97s] You're a great interviewer.
[1317.97s - 1319.41s] Like you have such great energy.
[1319.41s - 1321.25s] He really liked my passion.
[1321.25s - 1322.93s] And he said, you got to come meet Gary.
[1322.93s - 1324.05s] And I was like, no way.
[1324.05s - 1324.93s] Like I love Gary.
[1324.93s - 1327.17s] And so he took me to meet Gary for the first time.
[1327.17s - 1328.53s] We had a meeting in his office.
[1328.53s - 1330.45s] And that's how I built my relationship with him.
[1330.45s - 1331.81s] It was all thanks to Ryan.
[1331.81s - 1333.89s] And so when you think about it now, like when I'm...
[1333.89s - 1335.81s] Oh, I've never thought about it until what you're saying.
[1335.81s - 1336.37s] Yes.
[1336.37s - 1339.81s] Now when I look back, Ryan's been on the podcast like four times now, whatever.
[1339.81s - 1340.69s] I love his books.
[1341.25s - 1343.65s] So many relationships came out of that.
[1343.65s - 1346.85s] And so I think when you live in a world of I have nothing to offer
[1346.85s - 1350.29s] and I don't have anything, it becomes really hard to create.
[1350.29s - 1352.61s] And most people think when I have nothing,
[1353.25s - 1355.01s] I need to take from someone else.
[1355.01s - 1355.65s] Yes.
[1355.65s - 1356.93s] I don't have anything.
[1356.93s - 1359.33s] So I can't give anything if I don't have it.
[1359.33s - 1361.73s] So I need someone to give me money right now because I'm broke.
[1361.73s - 1362.61s] I'm poor.
[1362.61s - 1363.57s] I'm stuck.
[1363.57s - 1364.29s] I'm stressed.
[1364.29s - 1365.33s] I'm anxious.
[1365.33s - 1367.33s] I can't think out of myself.
[1367.33s - 1371.33s] And this first habit is really gratitude and generosity
[1371.33s - 1373.09s] is the gateway to abundance.
[1373.81s - 1376.53s] And it may not mean you're going to make money right away.
[1376.53s - 1379.41s] You didn't make money by having me on the show right away.
[1379.41s - 1380.77s] But we became friends.
[1380.77s - 1381.41s] I helped you.
[1381.41s - 1382.77s] You helped me over time.
[1382.77s - 1385.73s] We helped each other create more abundance together,
[1385.73s - 1388.05s] not only financially, which we've done together,
[1388.69s - 1392.85s] but a type of richness that isn't about money.
[1393.65s - 1396.29s] And this book, again, it's a money book,
[1396.29s - 1398.93s] but it's really like it doesn't matter how much money you have
[1398.93s - 1401.65s] if you don't feel like you have a rich life inside of you.
[1401.65s - 1402.21s] That's real.
[1402.21s - 1405.73s] It does not matter how much is in your bank account,
[1405.73s - 1407.49s] how big your net worth is.
[1407.49s - 1409.81s] If you don't feel like you have an abundant life,
[1409.81s - 1412.61s] if you're stressed, if you're overwhelmed, if you're anxious,
[1412.61s - 1416.37s] if you're constantly in drama, that is not abundance.
[1417.09s - 1420.93s] A high net worth does not mean you are free.
[1420.93s - 1425.97s] And the goal is for us to feel free every moment of our lives
[1425.97s - 1429.41s] as often as possible and allow money to be a tool
[1429.41s - 1433.65s] to create incredible opportunities, memories, moments
[1433.65s - 1436.29s] where you can be generous with it, with the people you care about,
[1436.29s - 1439.41s] the causes you care about, the institutions you care about
[1439.41s - 1443.81s] to serve more people and feel good about doing it,
[1443.81s - 1445.49s] not feel bad about doing it.
[1445.49s - 1447.33s] And that's part of this process.
[1447.33s - 1451.57s] Most people, when they lack money, they want to take from others.
[1451.57s - 1453.57s] They want someone to help them.
[1453.57s - 1455.33s] And you need to flip it on its head and say,
[1455.33s - 1456.53s] how can I help others?
[1456.53s - 1460.05s] Even when I have nothing, that is the time to be more generous
[1460.61s - 1464.21s] in and more gratitude and say, thank you for this opportunity.
[1464.21s - 1466.77s] Even if you have to just lie to yourself for a moment and say,
[1466.77s - 1469.01s] I'm stuck, I'm on my sister's couch, I have no money,
[1469.01s - 1471.49s] I'm four months and four months, I'm going to be out of an apartment
[1471.49s - 1473.49s] and I don't know where the money's coming.
[1473.49s - 1475.73s] Just say thank you, God, thank you, universe,
[1475.73s - 1478.45s] for this opportunity to learn, this opportunity to grow,
[1479.09s - 1480.61s] because I'll never be here again.
[1480.61s - 1482.93s] I don't know if you've had Ken Honda on, but he wrote...
[1482.93s - 1485.09s] I know Happy Money, but I haven't had him on.
[1485.09s - 1485.81s] Dude, he's so cool.
[1485.81s - 1487.17s] I love this approach to this.
[1487.73s - 1489.49s] And he's talking similar style about,
[1489.49s - 1490.85s] how do you just live a rich life?
[1491.41s - 1493.73s] Irrelevant of whether you have money or not.
[1493.73s - 1496.37s] And again, this is what I want people to get to.
[1496.37s - 1497.89s] When you are poor, when you're broke,
[1497.89s - 1499.25s] when you're struggling financially,
[1499.25s - 1502.53s] it feels really hard to feel abundant and rich.
[1503.41s - 1505.73s] And we want to start shifting our thoughts,
[1505.73s - 1507.25s] our emotions and our energy on,
[1507.97s - 1510.13s] okay, I know I'm in this financial situation.
[1510.13s - 1513.17s] It doesn't feel good, but in order to get out of it,
[1513.17s - 1515.01s] it's not feeling worse about it.
[1515.65s - 1519.33s] It's starting to feel better about me, better about my values,
[1519.33s - 1522.29s] my character, my kindness, my generosity,
[1522.29s - 1524.53s] and seeing how can I add value to others?
[1525.17s - 1526.85s] And that's the first thing we need to be thinking about.
[1526.85s - 1531.41s] How can I get into a richness inside of me to serve others
[1532.05s - 1534.53s] and take care of me at the same time?
[1534.53s - 1537.17s] And one of the practices or these social experiments
[1537.17s - 1540.45s] or exercises similar to you that Ken has
[1540.45s - 1542.13s] is that whenever money comes to him,
[1542.13s - 1544.93s] whether it's a check, whether it's a Venmo payment,
[1544.93s - 1547.57s] whatever it might be, he just says thank you to that money.
[1547.57s - 1549.09s] He looks at that number.
[1549.09s - 1551.73s] If it's a penny, if it's a million dollars,
[1551.73s - 1554.13s] if it's your normal check you get coming in
[1554.13s - 1555.41s] in the mail every two weeks,
[1555.41s - 1557.33s] he looks at it and says thank you.
[1557.33s - 1562.13s] And literally opens his heart and loves that money that comes to him.
[1562.13s - 1564.45s] He says thank you, where do you want to go?
[1565.33s - 1566.61s] Do you want to go to my bank account?
[1567.17s - 1568.37s] Do you want to go to my savings?
[1568.37s - 1569.25s] Do you want to go to investments?
[1569.25s - 1571.09s] Do you want to go towards paying off debt?
[1571.09s - 1572.13s] Do you want me to give you away?
[1572.69s - 1575.73s] And it may be a weird kind of like exercise,
[1576.29s - 1579.09s] but I love this approach to just being mindful of money
[1579.09s - 1581.49s] when it comes, say thank you.
[1581.49s - 1583.73s] And then when you pay bills, when you pay off debt,
[1583.73s - 1584.77s] say thank you as well.
[1585.41s - 1587.73s] Thank you for allowing me to pay off this debt.
[1587.73s - 1589.73s] Thank you for paying myself on bill
[1589.73s - 1591.65s] so I can call my friends and family that I love.
[1592.29s - 1595.81s] Thank you for the ability to live a richer life.
[1596.77s - 1599.09s] And when we start to approach money in that way,
[1600.21s - 1602.45s] it doesn't mean money's going to fall from the sky
[1602.45s - 1604.13s] and come to us abundantly.
[1604.13s - 1606.61s] But we're going to start to feel more rich
[1606.61s - 1608.45s] and abundant internally,
[1608.45s - 1611.97s] which that energy is what will attract more opportunities.
[1611.97s - 1614.45s] Those opportunities could lead to millions.
[1615.01s - 1617.09s] This hostess that came to you,
[1617.09s - 1620.77s] she brought that thankful energy, that present energy,
[1620.77s - 1623.73s] that loving, joyful, curious energy,
[1623.73s - 1628.61s] and it created an abundance of opportunities and connection.
[1628.61s - 1630.77s] You've reminded me of two really amazing things
[1630.77s - 1632.05s] that I love that I want to throw out,
[1632.05s - 1633.33s] because they're not us.
[1633.33s - 1634.21s] It's about other people.
[1634.21s - 1634.77s] Tell me.
[1634.77s - 1636.53s] Last night I was at a premiere of a new show
[1636.53s - 1638.29s] coming out in Hulu called Delhi Boys.
[1639.09s - 1640.61s] It's a full South Asian cast.
[1640.61s - 1642.53s] I was really excited to be just at the premiere
[1642.53s - 1645.57s] and just seeing my friends do this amazing thing.
[1646.13s - 1649.09s] And it was fascinating because me and Lilly Singh
[1649.09s - 1650.45s] were together, you know Lilly.
[1650.45s - 1652.69s] And so me and Lilly were together and were hanging out.
[1653.25s - 1654.05s] And this guy said,
[1654.05s - 1655.49s] hey, can I film you for two seconds?
[1655.49s - 1656.77s] He was working at the event.
[1656.77s - 1659.33s] And I believe this is what he does on his own.
[1659.33s - 1661.57s] I don't know his name, but I'll have to find it.
[1661.57s - 1664.53s] And he took a quick swipe of Lilly, like one show.
[1664.53s - 1665.81s] And she was like, oh my God, Jay, you got to do this.
[1665.81s - 1667.17s] He took a quick swipe with me.
[1667.17s - 1669.17s] He edited it on the spot
[1669.25s - 1672.77s] and he created this amazing reel of the event.
[1672.77s - 1673.97s] Like, and he was doing it quick.
[1673.97s - 1675.57s] And he was taking like two seconds of our time.
[1675.57s - 1677.09s] And me and Lilly both turned around and go,
[1677.09s - 1677.73s] is this what you do?
[1677.73s - 1678.93s] Like, how can we work with you?
[1678.93s - 1679.41s] All right, Reverend.
[1679.41s - 1681.81s] And like, you know, because it was such a great skill
[1681.81s - 1683.65s] and he was showcasing his talent.
[1683.65s - 1685.41s] He didn't ask us, he didn't charge us.
[1685.41s - 1686.45s] He didn't ask for us or anything.
[1686.45s - 1687.81s] He showed us his talent.
[1687.81s - 1689.81s] And all of a sudden, both of us were like this.
[1689.81s - 1691.73s] A few months ago, I went to a restaurant
[1692.45s - 1694.53s] that I'd never been to with some friends.
[1694.53s - 1696.45s] This wasn't like a fancy restaurant.
[1696.45s - 1698.29s] Just, you know, it was a great restaurant.
[1698.29s - 1699.97s] But it wasn't like fancy or anything like that.
[1700.69s - 1707.25s] The lady who was hosting, she had so much energy
[1707.25s - 1708.13s] and so much passion.
[1708.69s - 1709.89s] She was like, taking our order.
[1709.89s - 1711.41s] But then when we asked her for recommendation,
[1711.41s - 1713.41s] she knew every detail and like,
[1713.41s - 1716.13s] she got three job offers at that table.
[1716.13s - 1717.41s] Me and my friend, I never like,
[1717.41s - 1718.21s] what do you do?
[1718.21s - 1719.09s] What do you want to do?
[1719.73s - 1720.45s] Let's hire you.
[1720.45s - 1721.25s] Yeah, let's hire you
[1721.25s - 1723.97s] because we just, there was such an energy.
[1723.97s - 1726.21s] And so what you're saying is so true
[1726.21s - 1728.05s] because I'm now looking back at my own life.
[1728.61s - 1729.97s] And thinking about moments
[1729.97s - 1733.49s] where I've had that visceral reaction to someone.
[1733.49s - 1734.77s] And she was like, this is what I want to do.
[1734.77s - 1735.25s] This is my dream.
[1735.25s - 1736.37s] And one of my mates was like, all right,
[1736.37s - 1737.41s] well, let's connect.
[1737.41s - 1739.97s] Like, you know, he thinks she could work with him.
[1739.97s - 1741.49s] But it was again, the same thing you're saying.
[1741.49s - 1742.69s] It was just energy and passion.
[1742.69s - 1743.17s] Energy.
[1743.17s - 1744.45s] She didn't have any other,
[1744.45s - 1745.81s] she didn't have, it didn't matter about her college degree.
[1745.81s - 1746.69s] We didn't know a resume.
[1746.69s - 1747.25s] We didn't even look at it.
[1747.25s - 1749.81s] Doesn't matter what skill, other skills you have.
[1749.81s - 1751.73s] If you have energy, passion,
[1751.73s - 1754.53s] and a curiosity to care about someone,
[1754.53s - 1757.73s] you can go so far in that potential relationship.
[1757.73s - 1761.49s] Speaking about, you know, hostess or waiters or waitresses,
[1761.49s - 1763.81s] there were studies that psychologists did
[1763.81s - 1765.65s] around tipping and waiters.
[1766.29s - 1767.97s] And I don't know the exact statistic.
[1767.97s - 1769.33s] I know it was over a certain amount,
[1769.33s - 1770.85s] but I don't know the exact percentage.
[1770.85s - 1774.29s] But there are three things that you can do as a waiter
[1774.29s - 1775.65s] to make more money.
[1775.65s - 1778.53s] Getting higher tips based on psychology and these studies.
[1779.17s - 1782.61s] One is just introducing yourself and saying your name.
[1782.61s - 1783.73s] My name is Lewis Howes.
[1783.73s - 1784.69s] What's your name?
[1784.69s - 1785.65s] Thanks for being here today.
[1786.21s - 1788.85s] Saying your name creates a deeper connection.
[1788.85s - 1789.57s] I agree.
[1789.57s - 1791.97s] Making a recommendation of something.
[1791.97s - 1793.65s] You said she was making recommendations.
[1793.65s - 1795.33s] You know, making a recommendation,
[1795.33s - 1797.49s] hey, I really recommend this if you're into this,
[1797.49s - 1799.73s] or these are the best two options I would recommend.
[1800.37s - 1803.01s] Gets you a higher chance of getting a better tip.
[1803.01s - 1806.21s] And complimenting the person on their food choice.
[1806.77s - 1809.09s] I'll have the burger or the vegan burger.
[1809.09s - 1810.37s] That's a great choice.
[1811.01s - 1814.85s] Those three things will increase your ability to earn more tips.
[1814.85s - 1817.01s] And it's not like you had some other skill.
[1817.01s - 1819.33s] You just created connection with someone,
[1819.33s - 1821.89s] and you were trying to bring that energy to them.
[1822.53s - 1824.45s] And money is an energy.
[1824.45s - 1827.65s] And how we think and how we feel will dictate
[1827.65s - 1829.49s] the energy we have towards it.
[1830.05s - 1833.81s] And also you create money through your energy.
[1833.81s - 1836.29s] And so she had a certain energy with you,
[1836.29s - 1837.81s] and you're like, man, this is amazing.
[1837.81s - 1840.77s] You're recommending it to millions of people about this person.
[1840.77s - 1842.21s] That you just met for the first time.
[1842.21s - 1844.61s] It's like you could create so many opportunities
[1844.61s - 1848.93s] for not only financial abundance, but spiritual abundance
[1848.93s - 1853.17s] by bringing generosity, curiosity, energy,
[1853.17s - 1855.49s] joy, and love to someone's life.
[1855.49s - 1857.65s] And it doesn't have to take hours.
[1857.65s - 1860.37s] This was five minutes of this person's time.
[1860.37s - 1862.77s] She got three job offers over that night.
[1863.41s - 1865.25s] She could have had a different energy and said,
[1865.25s - 1866.61s] okay, here's your table, sit down.
[1867.25s - 1869.01s] And she would have had nothing.
[1869.01s - 1870.69s] But she could have went to Harvard
[1870.69s - 1872.13s] and had all these other skills.
[1872.13s - 1873.49s] And none of that would have mattered
[1873.49s - 1874.85s] without the energy she brought.
[1874.85s - 1876.05s] People who don't know this story
[1876.05s - 1878.69s] or have forgotten about it, like DRock and Gary Vee.
[1879.25s - 1880.53s] Like that's their journey, right?
[1880.53s - 1882.61s] Like DRock basically went up to Gary
[1882.61s - 1885.57s] and was like, hey, I'll just edit videos for you for free.
[1885.57s - 1887.33s] And now he's been traveling the world with Gary
[1887.33s - 1889.17s] for the last God knows how long they've been working together.
[1889.17s - 1890.29s] They've been traveling now, yeah.
[1890.29s - 1891.97s] Yeah. And he's such a great guy and he's awesome.
[1891.97s - 1895.01s] And it's just, but it all came from that, that idea of,
[1895.01s - 1896.93s] hey, I'm just going to edit these videos for you and do this.
[1896.93s - 1898.45s] And again, going back to what we said before,
[1898.45s - 1900.85s] is like when you have no money, when you're broke,
[1900.85s - 1903.49s] when you feel stressed out, overwhelmed, burnt out,
[1903.49s - 1907.09s] you lost your job, you feel like you need help.
[1907.09s - 1908.21s] And you may need help.
[1909.09s - 1911.17s] And the best way to create abundance
[1912.05s - 1916.37s] is to go from helplessness to helpfulness.
[1916.37s - 1918.53s] So instead of saying, I feel helpless.
[1918.53s - 1919.57s] I don't know what to do.
[1919.57s - 1922.05s] You've got to flip it and say, how can I be helpful?
[1922.05s - 1923.57s] How can I help myself?
[1923.57s - 1925.41s] But by also helping someone else,
[1925.41s - 1928.05s] how can I shift out of this negative energy
[1928.05s - 1929.65s] into an energy of abundance?
[1929.65s - 1931.41s] Which is so hard to do when you have nothing.
[1931.41s - 1933.49s] I remember for a year and a half,
[1933.49s - 1936.29s] feeling trapped on my sister's couch with no money.
[1936.29s - 1937.49s] Thinking, how am I going to do this?
[1938.13s - 1940.61s] And there's just got to be a decision where you say,
[1940.61s - 1942.93s] I'm going to get up and I'm going to get out of this funk,
[1942.93s - 1946.85s] out of this energy and choose and decide to bring energy
[1946.85s - 1949.73s] to someone else without asking for anything in return.
[1949.73s - 1952.29s] And when you do that, you'll start to build momentum.
[1952.29s - 1954.21s] And that's what's going to help you get to the next level.
[1954.21s - 1957.33s] The biggest trap is when you feel scarce
[1957.33s - 1960.69s] and you start making money and you still feel trapped.
[1960.69s - 1963.89s] When you see everyone else having fun with money
[1963.89s - 1966.45s] and going on that trip with their girlfriends
[1966.45s - 1969.49s] or buying that expensive car to show up to their guy friends
[1969.49s - 1972.45s] or getting the nice watches or having the cool shoes
[1972.45s - 1975.09s] and you're thinking, oh, if I could really have money,
[1975.09s - 1977.73s] then I could have these things that would make me feel cool
[1977.73s - 1978.45s] or feel better.
[1979.25s - 1982.05s] But if we can approach life and just be like, man,
[1982.05s - 1986.93s] life is so good with what I have, that is true wealth.
[1987.33s - 1991.09s] I asked them, if money walked in and you were at a party,
[1991.09s - 1991.97s] how would you respond?
[1992.85s - 1995.33s] And they said, I would run to the bar.
[1995.33s - 1997.41s] I would not make eye contact.
[1997.41s - 1999.01s] I would gossip behind their back
[1999.01s - 2000.77s] to other people there about money.
[2001.57s - 2002.53s] I would look down at them,
[2002.53s - 2004.21s] but then I would use them and abuse them
[2004.21s - 2005.65s] because I would really need money.
[2006.29s - 2008.61s] And I would ghost them afterwards.
[2008.61s - 2011.41s] And I go, wow, and they were like, yeah, I know,
[2011.41s - 2013.41s] it's really bad, but they were being honest.
[2013.41s - 2014.61s] So I want people to be honest.
[2014.61s - 2016.45s] Like, what is your relationship with money?
[2016.53s - 2017.41s] And just imagine.
[2017.41s - 2017.97s] That's crazy.
[2017.97s - 2021.25s] If you were money and someone treated you that way.
[2021.25s - 2022.93s] I remember the day after I realized
[2022.93s - 2024.85s] I was four months away from being broke,
[2024.85s - 2028.61s] I must have emailed a thousand people saying,
[2028.61s - 2029.57s] I will do anything.
[2029.57s - 2030.45s] Here are my skills.
[2030.45s - 2032.61s] I would edit videos.
[2032.61s - 2033.89s] I will consult.
[2033.89s - 2035.25s] I'll run your social media.
[2035.81s - 2038.05s] Those weren't things I wanted to do in my life,
[2038.69s - 2041.09s] but I needed to create a foundation from which
[2041.09s - 2043.49s] I could then invest that into what I wanted to do.
[2043.49s - 2046.53s] And actually that year, everything I made,
[2046.53s - 2048.21s] I invested into starting this podcast.
[2048.21s - 2048.61s] Yes.
[2048.61s - 2050.05s] So everything I made this year
[2050.05s - 2052.13s] went into launching on purpose
[2052.13s - 2053.97s] because that's not what I wanted to do.
[2053.97s - 2056.05s] I didn't want to edit other people's videos.
[2056.05s - 2059.01s] I didn't want to launch social media profiles.
[2059.01s - 2060.93s] I didn't want to coach and consult,
[2060.93s - 2062.77s] but I had those skills.
[2062.77s - 2064.53s] And I think this is one of the things sometimes
[2064.53s - 2068.69s] is that we all have skills that are valuable somewhere.
[2068.69s - 2070.29s] And there may not be the skills
[2070.29s - 2072.29s] that you want to do for the rest of your life.
[2072.29s - 2073.33s] But the season of life.
[2073.33s - 2074.45s] But the season of life.
[2074.45s - 2076.05s] And I think there's something to be said for that
[2076.05s - 2079.33s] because we all want to be paid for what we love doing.
[2079.89s - 2081.65s] But even my life today,
[2081.65s - 2083.73s] there's a lot of things I have to do.
[2083.73s - 2085.57s] And there's a lot of things I love to do.
[2085.57s - 2086.93s] And that's life.
[2086.93s - 2087.17s] Yeah.
[2087.17s - 2088.77s] Like you said, the seasonal side of things,
[2088.77s - 2091.25s] like when I was just getting started making money,
[2091.25s - 2094.53s] this was in 2008, 2009, 2010,
[2094.53s - 2097.49s] I was using LinkedIn as a platform and a tool
[2097.49s - 2100.93s] to meet CEOs, executives, and business leaders.
[2101.57s - 2103.17s] And I was helping them originally
[2103.17s - 2105.25s] with their LinkedIn profile to just saying,
[2105.25s - 2107.81s] Hey, how can I help you optimize your profile?
[2107.81s - 2109.65s] I see that it's missing some things here.
[2109.65s - 2111.09s] I'll do it for free.
[2111.09s - 2113.49s] And I did this to build relationships with them.
[2113.49s - 2113.97s] And through that,
[2113.97s - 2116.13s] they just all wanted to help me and give back to me.
[2116.13s - 2117.41s] And then eventually someone said,
[2117.41s - 2118.45s] Hey, I'll pay you for this.
[2118.45s - 2119.81s] This is really helpful.
[2119.81s - 2121.81s] And I was like, Oh, I can make money on LinkedIn.
[2121.81s - 2123.17s] It's not what I wanted to do,
[2123.17s - 2125.01s] but I had a skill to do it right then.
[2125.01s - 2126.45s] So I did that for a few years.
[2127.09s - 2129.09s] And once I had that foundation,
[2129.09s - 2131.57s] I used that money to launch the School of Greatness as well,
[2131.57s - 2133.33s] because I had a couple of years of runway now.
[2133.89s - 2135.97s] And I didn't want to do that forever,
[2135.97s - 2137.25s] but I did it for the season.
[2137.25s - 2139.41s] I got skills, I made money,
[2139.41s - 2142.13s] and I created a sense of freedom for myself
[2142.13s - 2144.13s] to do what I really wanted to do later.
[2144.13s - 2144.45s] Yeah.
[2144.45s - 2145.73s] What do you have to say to people who are saying
[2145.73s - 2147.49s] that you can manifest money?
[2147.49s - 2148.93s] Do you agree with that idea of?
[2148.93s - 2150.13s] It's an interesting story.
[2150.13s - 2153.25s] I was in New York last week and I said to myself,
[2153.25s - 2154.85s] and I have a lot of these different exercises
[2154.85s - 2155.97s] and games in the book,
[2156.61s - 2158.77s] to just give people as social experiments.
[2158.85s - 2161.97s] I think it's really powerful to give yourself experiment,
[2161.97s - 2163.89s] because I think when you experiment,
[2163.89s - 2167.01s] you allow yourself to explore possibilities.
[2167.65s - 2169.73s] And when you create an experiment for yourself,
[2169.73s - 2173.01s] you allow for the idea of magic to enter your life.
[2173.01s - 2175.33s] So I want you to just, as you're watching or listening,
[2175.33s - 2176.05s] I want you to say,
[2176.77s - 2180.77s] I allow for magic and abundance to manifest in my life.
[2180.77s - 2183.17s] I'm going to create a possibility
[2183.17s - 2184.61s] that this can happen in my life.
[2185.33s - 2186.85s] A moment, a synchronicity.
[2186.85s - 2188.53s] Someone might call me out of the blue.
[2188.53s - 2190.37s] Someone might hand me money randomly.
[2190.37s - 2192.37s] I'm going to allow for this moment to happen
[2192.37s - 2193.73s] and this magic to happen.
[2193.73s - 2194.61s] So I said to myself,
[2194.61s - 2196.53s] I want to follow my own practices, right?
[2196.53s - 2200.21s] And I went to see our friend Mel Robbins in Boston,
[2200.21s - 2201.73s] and I was in New York for a few days.
[2201.73s - 2203.25s] And I just said to myself,
[2203.25s - 2205.73s] money comes to me abundantly and freely in it.
[2205.73s - 2206.85s] I see it everywhere.
[2206.85s - 2209.81s] I just said this to myself every morning when I woke up
[2209.81s - 2211.17s] and when I went out of the hotel,
[2211.17s - 2213.25s] I said, money comes to me abundantly and freely
[2213.25s - 2214.53s] and I see it everywhere.
[2215.65s - 2217.73s] And I'm a magnet for money.
[2217.73s - 2218.77s] I'm a magnet for money.
[2218.77s - 2219.89s] I just kept saying this energy.
[2219.89s - 2220.69s] I'm a magnet for money.
[2220.69s - 2222.45s] I was just playful, this social experiment.
[2223.01s - 2225.89s] And when I was at Mel's, a penny dropped on the floor.
[2225.89s - 2227.73s] Someone was carrying a box and a penny fell on it.
[2227.73s - 2229.89s] I said, oh, look, money comes to me.
[2229.89s - 2230.77s] I see it everywhere.
[2230.77s - 2231.41s] It was a penny.
[2232.37s - 2233.49s] There's a point to this story.
[2233.49s - 2235.89s] And I pick it up and I say, Mel, do you want this?
[2235.89s - 2236.77s] And she goes, no, it's yours.
[2236.77s - 2238.45s] And I go, thank you, I receive.
[2238.45s - 2240.53s] Because when I relax, I receive.
[2240.53s - 2242.13s] And I'm a magnet for money.
[2242.13s - 2244.53s] Even it was a penny, I could notice it.
[2244.53s - 2246.05s] And I was like, all right, it came to me.
[2246.05s - 2247.49s] See, here's a win.
[2247.49s - 2248.77s] Here's a little win.
[2248.77s - 2249.73s] Let me do this again.
[2249.73s - 2253.01s] The next day I go to New York City and I'm in the subway.
[2253.01s - 2254.69s] And it's freezing right now in New York.
[2254.69s - 2255.65s] It's like 15 degrees.
[2256.21s - 2258.21s] And I'm just saying this to myself in the subway.
[2258.21s - 2260.77s] And as I get off the subway, I go up the stairs
[2261.33s - 2263.97s] and it's freaking filthy in the New York subway, right?
[2263.97s - 2266.29s] And the stairs are dirty and I see a penny heads up.
[2266.85s - 2268.93s] And I thought to myself, this is filthy.
[2268.93s - 2270.13s] This is dirty.
[2270.13s - 2271.49s] It's not valuable.
[2271.49s - 2272.61s] It's not enough money.
[2272.61s - 2273.89s] I don't need to pick this up.
[2273.89s - 2275.41s] But I was like, no, I'm doing this experiment.
[2275.41s - 2277.17s] Money comes to me abundantly and freely.
[2277.17s - 2278.93s] I'm a magnet for money.
[2278.93s - 2280.29s] And I'm going to manifest money, right?
[2280.93s - 2282.29s] And so I see it's heads up.
[2282.29s - 2283.57s] I pick it up, put it in my pocket.
[2283.57s - 2285.25s] And I just say, thank you, money for coming to me.
[2286.05s - 2287.81s] The next day I put it on my bedside table.
[2287.81s - 2288.85s] I don't think anything of it.
[2288.85s - 2290.85s] The next day I wake up and I look at this penny
[2291.41s - 2294.29s] and I said, because I'm doing this experiment every day,
[2294.29s - 2295.33s] I'm a magnet for money.
[2295.33s - 2297.33s] Money comes from me abundantly and freely.
[2297.33s - 2300.45s] And I look at it as a reminder, these two pennies.
[2301.25s - 2303.65s] Look, this is a reminder that money came to me.
[2303.65s - 2306.53s] Maybe it's not thousands of dollars or millions of dollars.
[2306.53s - 2308.61s] It's not something that's magically right in here.
[2308.61s - 2311.01s] But it's a reminder that something is possible.
[2312.05s - 2314.85s] And I flipped over this one, no, I looked at the penny
[2314.85s - 2317.09s] because it was heads up and I noticed something.
[2317.09s - 2319.41s] I go, oh, that's really interesting.
[2319.41s - 2322.45s] It said 1945 on this penny.
[2322.45s - 2323.97s] That's an 80-year-old penny.
[2323.97s - 2325.81s] And I go, huh, that's unique.
[2325.81s - 2327.49s] I haven't seen a penny that old in a long time.
[2327.49s - 2329.89s] And I flip it over and I notice something.
[2329.89s - 2330.93s] And I get chills thinking about it.
[2330.93s - 2332.53s] I notice it's a wheat penny.
[2332.53s - 2334.21s] I don't know if you know what a wheat penny is.
[2334.21s - 2335.01s] No, I don't.
[2335.01s - 2338.13s] So a wheat penny looks different than a normal penny.
[2338.13s - 2341.97s] It's got like two stocks of wheat on the outside of the penny.
[2341.97s - 2343.09s] It's this old penny.
[2343.65s - 2349.17s] And I look it up and I Google 1945 wheat penny value.
[2350.05s - 2351.17s] And one just sold.
[2351.17s - 2353.57s] I kid you not, I get chills thinking about it.
[2353.57s - 2355.41s] One just sold, guess for how much?
[2355.41s - 2356.37s] I have no idea.
[2356.37s - 2357.49s] $4,000.
[2357.49s - 2358.29s] No way.
[2358.29s - 2358.77s] Online.
[2359.33s - 2360.61s] One sold for $4,000.
[2360.61s - 2362.29s] Now it's all based on the condition
[2362.29s - 2363.17s] and all these different things.
[2363.17s - 2364.21s] Like, who knows?
[2364.21s - 2365.73s] Maybe it's worth $20.
[2365.73s - 2367.17s] Maybe it's worth $5,000.
[2367.17s - 2368.61s] Maybe it's worth $100.
[2368.61s - 2373.57s] But the idea is that there was more value inside of that penny
[2373.57s - 2375.33s] than what met the eye originally.
[2375.33s - 2376.13s] Yeah.
[2376.13s - 2380.37s] And the experiment of let me be open to possibilities
[2380.37s - 2381.65s] for money to come to me.
[2381.65s - 2386.21s] And what I thought was two pennies might be $2,000.
[2386.21s - 2388.37s] And all I had to do was be willing to look for it,
[2389.17s - 2392.53s] be willing to pick it up and say, I receive, thank you.
[2393.17s - 2395.57s] If I didn't look for it, if I didn't set that intention,
[2395.57s - 2398.69s] if I didn't see the possibilities in front of me,
[2398.69s - 2400.61s] I may not have received that penny
[2400.61s - 2402.61s] that could have been worth thousands.
[2402.61s - 2403.89s] And it's the same thing in life.
[2404.53s - 2407.09s] We may not see the opportunity in front of us right now.
[2407.09s - 2409.09s] We may not reach out to the people we already know
[2409.09s - 2411.97s] and say, hey, this is what I'm looking to create in my life.
[2411.97s - 2413.09s] I have these skills.
[2413.09s - 2413.97s] I have these talents.
[2414.53s - 2415.97s] Is there anything that you need right now
[2415.97s - 2417.97s] that I can be of service for you with?
[2417.97s - 2418.61s] Yeah.
[2418.61s - 2420.13s] And that's for that first year,
[2420.13s - 2423.41s] how you created multiple six figures in that first year
[2423.41s - 2426.53s] when you had nothing was reaching out to hundreds of people.
[2427.09s - 2429.01s] That was you either setting the intention,
[2429.65s - 2431.33s] seeing that there might be possibilities,
[2431.33s - 2435.01s] and doing the work to manifest hundreds of thousands
[2435.01s - 2436.21s] that first six months.
[2437.01s - 2439.81s] So by doing that effort, setting the intention,
[2440.37s - 2442.69s] by saying, I'm open to possibilities.
[2442.69s - 2444.93s] I'm open to receiving opportunities that come to me,
[2444.93s - 2446.45s] but I have to be willing to look for them.
[2446.45s - 2447.81s] I have to be willing to ask for them.
[2447.81s - 2449.49s] I have to be willing to put myself out there.
[2450.21s - 2451.89s] And receive and say, yes, thank you.
[2451.89s - 2453.17s] I would do this work.
[2453.17s - 2455.09s] And that's what I think people need to be thinking about.
[2455.09s - 2457.01s] Can you manifest millions?
[2457.01s - 2457.41s] Yes.
[2457.41s - 2459.17s] If you're willing to set a clear intention,
[2459.17s - 2461.09s] if you're willing to reach out and say,
[2461.09s - 2463.73s] here's what I'm willing to offer and add value in,
[2463.73s - 2465.49s] I want to help you achieve these goals,
[2466.05s - 2469.25s] you're creating more potential to manifest money.
[2469.25s - 2469.57s] Yeah.
[2469.57s - 2472.85s] I love that penny story because I'll tell you a bit about
[2472.85s - 2475.97s] what I do and I do a similar thing and it comes from my tradition.
[2475.97s - 2477.73s] Do you have a money mantra?
[2477.73s - 2479.01s] No, we don't say something.
[2479.57s - 2480.21s] I'll tell you about it.
[2480.21s - 2480.61s] Yes.
[2480.61s - 2485.57s] So in our tradition, there's a God or a Goddess
[2486.21s - 2488.77s] for each aspect of society.
[2488.77s - 2489.09s] Money.
[2489.09s - 2491.97s] And so there is God, as in there's one God,
[2491.97s - 2493.81s] but then there's loads of different Gods
[2493.81s - 2495.73s] for different departments of society.
[2495.73s - 2498.29s] Kind of like you have a president or a prime minister
[2498.29s - 2499.89s] and then you have the cabinet and that God is.
[2499.89s - 2501.09s] Who's the money God is?
[2501.09s - 2503.17s] So it's a Goddess called Lakshmi.
[2503.17s - 2503.81s] Lakshmi.
[2503.81s - 2505.73s] Yeah, Lakshmi means wealth or fortune.
[2505.73s - 2506.69s] It's like luxury almost.
[2506.69s - 2507.81s] Yeah, it's like Lakshmi.
[2507.81s - 2508.77s] Maybe that's where it comes from.
[2509.41s - 2512.29s] But Lakshmi is the Goddess of fortune or the Goddess of wealth.
[2512.93s - 2516.77s] And so you would never, ever put your foot on a Goddess.
[2517.49s - 2520.37s] So whenever you're walking the streets and you see pennies around,
[2520.93s - 2522.69s] you're never meant to just walk past them.
[2522.69s - 2524.85s] You're actually meant to pick them up and put them to your head.
[2524.85s - 2526.77s] So that's kind of like part of our culture.
[2526.77s - 2528.53s] And so whenever I'm walking around the streets of New York
[2528.53s - 2531.01s] or LA, wherever I am or subways, I do the same thing.
[2531.01s - 2531.41s] Interesting.
[2531.41s - 2532.69s] I'll always pick it up.
[2532.69s - 2534.61s] And it's really funny because someone who's with me will be like,
[2534.61s - 2535.33s] what are you doing?
[2535.33s - 2537.25s] Like, you know, like why are you doing that?
[2537.33s - 2539.25s] I'm like, because I'm showing respect.
[2539.25s - 2541.97s] I'm actually showing respect to the Goddess of fortune.
[2541.97s - 2542.61s] So good, man.
[2542.61s - 2543.49s] And so that's what it is.
[2543.49s - 2545.81s] It's like I'm showing respect to the Goddess of fortune
[2545.81s - 2548.45s] by picking it up and usually give that money to charity
[2548.45s - 2549.41s] or whatever it may be.
[2549.41s - 2551.17s] It's not, it's not, you're trying to keep on it.
[2551.17s - 2552.61s] You may give it away, whatever.
[2552.61s - 2553.97s] But the point is you're saying,
[2553.97s - 2558.29s] I'm not disrespecting the Goddess of fortune wherever I see her.
[2558.29s - 2558.93s] That's beautiful.
[2558.93s - 2561.73s] Because I want to have a respectful relationship with money.
[2561.73s - 2563.89s] I actually really love practices like that.
[2563.89s - 2566.93s] Because I think it goes back to the point you're making that
[2567.01s - 2569.73s] we have a relationship with everything.
[2569.73s - 2570.13s] Every day.
[2570.13s - 2571.33s] You have a relationship with your body.
[2571.33s - 2572.53s] You have a relationship with your mind.
[2572.53s - 2574.53s] You have a relationship with your partner.
[2574.53s - 2575.73s] And you have a relationship with money.
[2575.73s - 2579.89s] And so speaking to money and speaking about money
[2579.89s - 2583.01s] is something you have to do if you want to love that thing
[2583.01s - 2584.45s] and you want it to love you back.
[2584.45s - 2584.61s] Right.
[2584.61s - 2586.37s] If you never talk about your partner
[2586.37s - 2588.13s] and you never talk to your partner,
[2588.13s - 2589.01s] how are they going to love you?
[2589.01s - 2589.97s] And how are you going to love them?
[2589.97s - 2592.93s] Imagine you're, you know, Roddy for the next month,
[2592.93s - 2593.81s] you never say thank you.
[2593.81s - 2594.45s] Yeah.
[2594.45s - 2595.57s] You never look her in the eyes.
[2596.13s - 2597.17s] You never speak to her.
[2597.17s - 2598.53s] You avoid her constantly.
[2598.53s - 2600.77s] Imagine like your relationship's going to suffer.
[2600.77s - 2602.29s] You know, I'm sure you guys will figure it out,
[2602.29s - 2605.49s] but imagine that's a lifetime of a relationship.
[2606.05s - 2607.65s] It cannot survive.
[2607.65s - 2610.61s] And here's a great question that I want everyone to ask themselves
[2610.61s - 2613.73s] and another exercise that I want everyone to think about
[2613.73s - 2615.97s] right now, whether you're watching or listening.
[2615.97s - 2618.21s] I want you to comment on the YouTube below
[2618.93s - 2621.17s] what opened up for you during this moment.
[2621.17s - 2623.01s] And I'm going to give you the exercise, Jay.
[2623.01s - 2625.01s] So imagine this door opens.
[2626.54s - 2629.98s] And it's a person and this person is money.
[2630.54s - 2632.54s] It's the idea of money.
[2632.54s - 2634.38s] It's a person that walks in, right?
[2634.38s - 2634.94s] Is money.
[2635.90s - 2640.03s] And could you, as an example,
[2640.03s - 2641.55s] for people to imagine this as well,
[2642.43s - 2645.31s] what does that person look like when they come in?
[2646.35s - 2647.23s] What would you do?
[2648.32s - 2649.92s] What would you say or not say?
[2649.92s - 2652.48s] Could you share kind of what that would be like for you?
[2652.48s - 2654.24s] Money, a person walks in, they are money.
[2654.24s - 2656.56s] They are the representation of your relationship with money.
[2657.28s - 2658.80s] How would you show up and react?
[2658.80s - 2661.36s] So in our culture, because it would be Lakshmi walking,
[2661.36s - 2663.20s] and I'll show you a visual of her afterwards,
[2663.84s - 2666.40s] you would actually bow down, like you'd have that.
[2666.40s - 2667.60s] And that's a sign of respect,
[2667.60s - 2670.48s] not a sign of surrender or subjugation,
[2670.48s - 2671.52s] but a sign of respect.
[2671.52s - 2675.28s] Like you'd bow, you'd offer her whatever she wanted.
[2675.28s - 2676.56s] Like you'd be like, what do you need?
[2676.56s - 2677.44s] Like what would you like?
[2677.44s - 2679.52s] What would you like a place to sit?
[2679.52s - 2680.48s] Kind of like a guest in your home.
[2680.48s - 2681.44s] She'd be like a generous host.
[2681.44s - 2682.96s] You'd see them like a guest in your home.
[2682.96s - 2684.00s] Yeah, like what would you like?
[2684.80s - 2687.60s] Can I get you something to drink, whatever it may be?
[2688.16s - 2688.96s] Obviously she's a goddess.
[2688.96s - 2689.76s] She doesn't need anything.
[2689.76s - 2693.76s] But the point is that's how the hospitality would still be carried through.
[2693.76s - 2694.48s] That's cool.
[2694.48s - 2696.32s] And then you'd thank her as well.
[2696.32s - 2700.56s] Like you'd start every connection with a god or a goddess with gratitude.
[2700.56s - 2704.24s] So that'd be like a genuine appreciation
[2704.88s - 2707.20s] and an ability to share how you feel.
[2707.20s - 2708.96s] Like I think being vulnerable and saying,
[2708.96s - 2711.20s] hey, like it's been really tough this month.
[2711.20s - 2712.48s] Like I'm really struggling right now.
[2712.48s - 2713.76s] Like this is what I'm going through.
[2713.76s - 2714.24s] Yeah.
[2714.24s - 2714.96s] I need your help.
[2714.96s - 2716.64s] Like a prayer almost.
[2716.64s - 2717.04s] Interesting.
[2717.04s - 2717.84s] Of sorts.
[2717.84s - 2718.80s] That's beautiful.
[2718.80s - 2720.96s] And I've been asking a lot of people this.
[2720.96s - 2723.36s] And so I love to hear people's responses and be honest
[2723.36s - 2726.96s] in the YouTube comments below of your relationship with money.
[2726.96s - 2729.68s] I asked someone close to me, someone younger,
[2729.68s - 2731.44s] probably in their late 20s.
[2731.44s - 2736.08s] I asked them, if money walked in and you were at a party, how would you respond?
[2736.88s - 2739.44s] And they said, I would run to the bar.
[2739.44s - 2741.52s] I would not make eye contact.
[2741.52s - 2744.88s] I would gossip behind their back to other people there about money.
[2745.68s - 2748.32s] I would look down at them, but then I would use them and abuse them
[2748.32s - 2749.76s] because I would really need money.
[2750.32s - 2752.64s] And I would ghost them afterwards.
[2752.64s - 2754.56s] And I go, and I go, wow.
[2754.56s - 2756.32s] And they were like, yeah, I know it's really bad,
[2756.32s - 2757.52s] but they're being honest.
[2757.52s - 2758.64s] So I want people to be honest.
[2758.64s - 2760.56s] Like what is your relationship with money?
[2760.56s - 2761.44s] And just imagine.
[2761.44s - 2762.08s] That's crazy.
[2762.08s - 2765.20s] If you were money and someone treated you that way,
[2765.20s - 2767.04s] if they wouldn't look at you, they avoid you,
[2767.04s - 2768.80s] they speak poorly behind your back,
[2768.80s - 2771.04s] they would use you and abuse you when they wanted you.
[2771.04s - 2773.76s] And then they ghost you when they didn't want to talk to you.
[2774.40s - 2776.96s] Do you think money would want to keep showing up in your life?
[2776.96s - 2779.28s] If they were a person, if they were a person,
[2779.28s - 2781.28s] would they want to be in your life?
[2781.28s - 2784.32s] Or they feel, yeah, this isn't a good relationship for me.
[2784.32s - 2788.00s] And your show is all about how people get healed, healthy, and whole.
[2788.64s - 2790.88s] And if you want to create a richer, more abundant life,
[2790.88s - 2795.76s] you have to create a healthy relationship with money in your life.
[2795.76s - 2800.16s] And look at it as if this was a love of my life.
[2800.24s - 2803.84s] Not in a worshiping, like I worship it no matter what,
[2803.84s - 2807.44s] but more of like this is like a person that I love.
[2807.44s - 2808.96s] And I want to treat them with care.
[2808.96s - 2810.24s] I want to be a great host.
[2810.88s - 2811.92s] How can I show up?
[2812.72s - 2814.56s] And it doesn't mean it's always going to be perfect,
[2814.56s - 2819.12s] but how can I show up and be generous, be kind, be patient, listen,
[2819.76s - 2822.40s] be aware, and be of service to it?
[2822.40s - 2823.92s] Yeah, I didn't make a huge difference.
[2823.92s - 2824.72s] Huge difference.
[2824.72s - 2826.88s] I'm not saying you haven't had a beautiful, abundant,
[2827.44s - 2831.04s] peaceful life as well with money, but I would bet to say
[2831.04s - 2835.28s] that you've also experienced stress and overwhelm with money
[2835.28s - 2837.36s] for sure, more than having no money.
[2837.36s - 2840.40s] And a lot of people get blocked because they know that like,
[2840.40s - 2842.48s] oh, more money, more problems.
[2842.48s - 2844.40s] This is another like money lie, right?
[2844.40s - 2846.08s] Or money like wound that people might have.
[2846.08s - 2847.04s] Like I don't want to make more money
[2847.04s - 2848.88s] because I see people who do have money.
[2848.88s - 2849.92s] They're constantly stressed.
[2850.64s - 2852.32s] They're not generous with it.
[2852.32s - 2852.88s] They're stingy.
[2852.88s - 2853.92s] They don't even tip at all.
[2853.92s - 2856.40s] They're even more stingy with it and they have it.
[2856.40s - 2858.32s] So what's the point of having it if they're not generous?
[2858.32s - 2859.20s] I don't want to be like that.
[2860.08s - 2863.60s] And there can be money traps or money wounds when you have money,
[2863.60s - 2866.24s] if you haven't learned how to heal that relationship.
[2866.24s - 2868.40s] And so it's learning how to heal the relationship
[2868.40s - 2870.56s] so that when you grow your net worth,
[2871.12s - 2877.20s] you also increase your self-worth inside and feel peaceful about it.
[2877.20s - 2882.16s] You expand your nervous system, your container to receive abundantly
[2882.16s - 2883.28s] so that it's not scary.
[2883.28s - 2884.16s] It's not stressful.
[2884.72s - 2887.36s] You can receive more and you can give more
[2887.36s - 2889.04s] because you know that the more you relax,
[2889.04s - 2891.20s] the more you receive and when you give,
[2891.20s - 2892.96s] it's going to come back in some way.
[2892.96s - 2894.48s] I struggled with that.
[2894.48s - 2896.80s] My first six, seven, eight years of making money,
[2896.80s - 2899.60s] I hoarded money because I was afraid to go broke again.
[2900.24s - 2902.16s] And it limited me in certain ways
[2902.16s - 2903.60s] and it made me feel stressful
[2903.60s - 2905.52s] and it made me feel like people were trying to take advantage of me
[2905.52s - 2906.48s] and take my money.
[2906.48s - 2912.08s] It doesn't feel rich having money and living in scarcity still.
[2912.08s - 2916.16s] There was a beautiful thing that we'd always repeat in the monastery.
[2916.16s - 2918.32s] It was like, God doesn't see what you give,
[2918.32s - 2919.68s] God sees what you hold back.
[2920.56s - 2922.32s] And so there's not this, you know,
[2922.32s - 2925.28s] because we can sometimes become egotistical about how much we give
[2925.92s - 2927.60s] and it's like, well, you've got one hand behind your back
[2927.60s - 2928.96s] and you just made that point.
[2928.96s - 2930.48s] It's that pinch.
[2930.48s - 2934.80s] It's that, are you giving where there's a challenge to give?
[2934.80s - 2938.08s] Because that's where we're healing because you can get really egotistical.
[2938.08s - 2940.16s] Like, hey, if you were worth a billion
[2940.24s - 2942.00s] and you signed a million dollar check,
[2942.00s - 2945.92s] like, I know people that are making $3 million in interest a day.
[2945.92s - 2950.08s] Like, so you're writing a million dollar check is not the same.
[2950.08s - 2951.68s] This also applies when you have very little.
[2951.68s - 2953.20s] So my parents who didn't make a lot,
[2954.00s - 2956.88s] when they were giving, it felt like a lot.
[2956.88s - 2957.92s] It felt like a lot.
[2957.92s - 2960.00s] And so like, what we're saying is that,
[2960.00s - 2964.72s] that this thought of being a giver has to be core to us.
[2964.72s - 2966.48s] You know, my dad was a lot like that too.
[2967.20s - 2968.96s] He had strangers knocking on the door
[2968.96s - 2971.44s] that somehow convinced him to stay with us
[2971.44s - 2974.32s] for like three months in the summer who were,
[2975.04s - 2977.28s] and he just opened his doors and said, yes.
[2977.28s - 2978.00s] Like, okay.
[2978.00s - 2981.04s] And so he was just like, like your parents, like, okay,
[2981.04s - 2983.12s] you need a place to stay for a week, a month, two months.
[2983.12s - 2984.16s] Cool. We'll figure it out.
[2984.16s - 2985.28s] We'll feed you. We'll do this.
[2985.28s - 2986.96s] As long as we feel like you're doing something good
[2986.96s - 2988.24s] and we're trying to support you.
[2988.80s - 2991.52s] And I think it's, you don't have to give money to feel rich.
[2991.52s - 2992.00s] Yes.
[2992.00s - 2993.84s] You can be vendor generous with your time,
[2993.84s - 2997.04s] with your resources and other ways, with your food.
[2997.04s - 3000.48s] It's like, you can give in other ways
[3000.48s - 3002.56s] and create a richness of life.
[3002.56s - 3007.04s] And that's the key is to feel rich and abundant and free.
[3007.04s - 3010.24s] And if you feel that, when you start making money,
[3010.24s - 3011.68s] you're going to continue to feel free.
[3012.40s - 3015.52s] The biggest trap is when you feel scarce
[3015.52s - 3018.96s] and you start making money and you still feel trapped.
[3018.96s - 3020.96s] You still don't feel free.
[3020.96s - 3023.44s] That isn't even greater prison in my mind
[3023.44s - 3026.24s] that you're living in scarcity when you have money.
[3026.24s - 3027.60s] I mean, there's so many people right now
[3027.60s - 3029.68s] that have the pressure to save money
[3029.68s - 3031.04s] because we've been talking about making money.
[3031.04s - 3031.60s] Yes.
[3031.60s - 3032.96s] But there's this pressure to save money.
[3032.96s - 3036.08s] And how do you find that balance between spending comfortably
[3036.88s - 3040.40s] if you have the ability versus like saving for your future
[3040.40s - 3041.04s] or your family?
[3041.04s - 3043.12s] Like how do you think about that version?
[3043.12s - 3045.84s] Well, I think when you can live beneath your means
[3045.84s - 3047.76s] and feel abundant, you've won.
[3048.40s - 3050.32s] So when you live beneath your means
[3050.32s - 3053.20s] and you don't need extra stuff, you've won.
[3053.20s - 3057.63s] I just watched the Count of Monte Cristo the other night.
[3057.63s - 3061.15s] It's an incredible movie of a guy who has nothing.
[3061.15s - 3064.27s] He was born by, you know, back in the, I don't know,
[3064.27s - 3066.51s] 1700s or something, it's a period piece.
[3066.51s - 3069.87s] He was born of like a clerk, a guy who makes no money.
[3070.43s - 3073.39s] And his friend was born of like some general
[3073.39s - 3074.83s] who had a lot of money or something.
[3075.55s - 3080.43s] And this poor kid that grew up friends didn't have anything,
[3080.43s - 3081.47s] but he had the world.
[3082.11s - 3085.79s] He had no money, no possessions, but he just approached life
[3085.79s - 3088.27s] and was like, man, but here's a piece of string.
[3088.27s - 3090.19s] Here's a rock that I can play with.
[3090.19s - 3092.75s] Like I can just imagine the beauty of the world
[3092.75s - 3096.19s] and he appreciated everything even though he had no money.
[3096.91s - 3099.95s] And I think in some ways it's so hard to look at that
[3099.95s - 3102.59s] when we see Instagram and TikTok where everyone has things.
[3102.59s - 3103.79s] That's the hard part, yeah.
[3103.79s - 3106.91s] When you see everyone else having fun with money
[3106.91s - 3109.47s] and going on that trip with their girlfriends
[3109.47s - 3112.51s] or buying that expensive car to show up to their guy friends
[3112.51s - 3115.47s] or getting the nice watches or having the cool shoes
[3115.47s - 3118.11s] and you're thinking, oh, if I could really have money,
[3118.11s - 3120.75s] then I could have these things that would make me feel cool
[3120.75s - 3121.47s] or feel better.
[3122.27s - 3125.07s] But if we can approach life and just be like, man,
[3125.07s - 3130.35s] life is so good with what I have, that is true wealth.
[3130.35s - 3132.19s] That is true abundance and happiness.
[3132.83s - 3135.23s] And it doesn't mean you shouldn't strive to create more.
[3135.23s - 3136.91s] If you want more, if you want to have nice shoes
[3136.91s - 3138.35s] or a nice watch, cool.
[3138.35s - 3140.19s] You've got to learn how to make money
[3140.19s - 3142.03s] and you want to learn how to make money easy,
[3142.03s - 3143.07s] not make money hard.
[3144.11s - 3146.43s] That is a process in developing these skills,
[3146.43s - 3147.87s] these talents within you
[3147.87s - 3150.27s] and seeing how you can monetize those skills.
[3150.99s - 3153.39s] And I'm not saying don't splurge on certain things
[3153.39s - 3155.87s] if you want to, but you have to understand the consequences.
[3155.87s - 3159.31s] If you're going to splurge on something to have fun
[3159.31s - 3162.03s] with friends or go on trips and spend this money
[3162.03s - 3164.03s] that you maybe don't have,
[3164.03s - 3167.23s] just know there might be a consequence to that later.
[3167.23s - 3168.59s] If you have to use a credit card,
[3168.59s - 3170.91s] you have to pay that debt with interest later.
[3171.63s - 3175.39s] So just know there's a cost to splurging
[3175.39s - 3177.39s] or spending when you don't have it.
[3177.95s - 3182.11s] I'm a big fan of saving and investing
[3182.11s - 3184.83s] so that you can have freedom in the future
[3184.83s - 3186.67s] and feel rich continually
[3186.67s - 3190.19s] and not needing to buy things to feel richer.
[3190.19s - 3190.59s] Yeah.
[3190.59s - 3193.47s] What about this idea of I want to make money quick?
[3194.03s - 3196.11s] Like I just want to make a million dollars in a week.
[3196.11s - 3199.79s] I want to find that hack that solves my money problems.
[3199.79s - 3200.75s] Like what's your take on that?
[3200.75s - 3201.47s] Is that possible?
[3201.47s - 3202.67s] I've got money wounds.
[3202.67s - 3206.35s] And it's because I wanted to make easy money in my past,
[3206.99s - 3208.11s] not make money easy.
[3208.91s - 3212.11s] And I don't know anyone that doesn't want to make easy money.
[3212.67s - 3215.71s] Like our ego wants it to come to us now.
[3215.71s - 3217.07s] And you want to find the quick hack
[3217.07s - 3220.59s] or the quick investment that's got a 10x in two months.
[3221.47s - 3224.35s] Sure, there's always outliers that figure out a way to do that.
[3224.35s - 3225.87s] But every time I've tried to do that,
[3225.87s - 3228.59s] I've lost my money and it's been painful.
[3228.59s - 3230.35s] And I'm like, okay, I think I've learned that lesson,
[3230.35s - 3233.55s] but here's this new like quick, easy money opportunity.
[3234.19s - 3236.83s] And every time I do it again, I'm like, what was I thinking?
[3237.63s - 3241.63s] You see that others act like there's a way to do it so easy.
[3241.63s - 3244.51s] If you just invest in crypto, if you just invest in this,
[3244.51s - 3247.31s] if you just do this thing, you're going to make quick and easy money.
[3247.95s - 3250.91s] I don't know anyone who's made hundreds of millions,
[3250.91s - 3253.55s] millions or billions who's lived that way.
[3254.35s - 3258.35s] They might have invested and gone all in on one business
[3258.35s - 3259.95s] and created generational wealth.
[3259.95s - 3263.71s] Or maybe they went all in on investing in one main stock
[3263.71s - 3266.27s] that ended up 10 or 20xing over time.
[3267.15s - 3272.19s] But going the quick, make easy money way doesn't usually work
[3272.19s - 3274.99s] and it's painful lessons you have to live afterwards.
[3274.99s - 3278.19s] So I don't know, have you ever made quick, easy money?
[3278.19s - 3279.95s] No, no, I haven't for sure.
[3279.95s - 3284.51s] And I've probably made mistakes when I had a bad relationship with money.
[3285.31s - 3291.79s] I remember one of my mentors in like 2013 told me to invest in crypto.
[3292.43s - 3296.75s] And at the time I thought to myself, I've only got like,
[3296.75s - 3304.11s] I only like at that time in my life, I probably had $1,000 saved
[3304.11s - 3306.03s] because I'd just come out, I'd just started working.
[3306.03s - 3307.47s] I didn't have the money.
[3307.47s - 3309.87s] So I was thinking $1,000, what's he going to do?
[3309.87s - 3310.75s] Obviously I was stupid.
[3310.75s - 3311.55s] I didn't know.
[3311.55s - 3313.07s] That also wanted to have been quick.
[3313.07s - 3313.79s] It would have been quick.
[3313.79s - 3314.51s] It would have taken 10 years.
[3314.51s - 3315.07s] It would have taken 10, 15 years.
[3315.07s - 3315.87s] Yeah, it would have been quick.
[3315.87s - 3318.11s] It's like, we could always look back and say,
[3318.11s - 3320.75s] oh, our friend told us to invest in this thing 10 years ago.
[3320.75s - 3323.55s] And if I imagine if I did it 10 years, yeah, just like any stock.
[3323.55s - 3324.03s] Yeah.
[3324.03s - 3325.71s] If you invest it and wait 10 years,
[3326.51s - 3328.83s] it should go up if the company continues to do well.
[3328.83s - 3330.27s] No, I've never made easy money.
[3330.27s - 3331.07s] And I agree.
[3331.07s - 3335.71s] You actually have made easy money after putting in a decade plus of work,
[3336.43s - 3339.95s] a decade of developing skills, of monetizing your skills,
[3339.95s - 3343.63s] and following the seven habits we talk about in this book, which is,
[3343.63s - 3345.15s] yeah, you can make easy money now.
[3345.15s - 3348.75s] You can get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to speak for 60 minutes
[3348.75s - 3353.71s] because you've added so much value in the world for the past decade plus.
[3354.35s - 3357.87s] And even a decade before that of spiritual practice,
[3357.87s - 3359.63s] before you even learned how to make money.
[3359.63s - 3364.91s] So two decades of how do I develop skills within me
[3364.91s - 3366.35s] to serve people?
[3366.35s - 3370.35s] Whether it be one on one, one to 10, one to 10,000,
[3370.35s - 3375.15s] how do I develop those skills to serve and give generously?
[3375.15s - 3378.03s] You have followed this mindset perfectly,
[3378.03s - 3380.43s] which is a mindset of generosity and gratitude.
[3381.07s - 3384.19s] And that's all you did for essentially the last two decades.
[3384.19s - 3386.11s] How can I learn how to become a better human?
[3386.91s - 3389.07s] How can I give generously?
[3389.07s - 3392.59s] And how can I be appreciative and grateful for the life that I have?
[3392.59s - 3396.27s] And you had no money for almost four years as a monk,
[3396.27s - 3399.79s] but I would bet that you lived a beautifully rich life.
[3400.51s - 3403.07s] You didn't need the money to feel rich.
[3403.95s - 3405.79s] You felt provided for.
[3405.79s - 3407.07s] You had nature.
[3407.07s - 3408.27s] You had community.
[3408.27s - 3409.63s] You were learning.
[3409.63s - 3410.99s] You got to be on purpose.
[3410.99s - 3412.19s] You got to serve.
[3412.19s - 3414.91s] And what a beautiful gift to receive.
[3415.55s - 3417.23s] And you had no money in your bank account,
[3417.79s - 3420.19s] but you were probably one of the richest people that you knew.
[3420.19s - 3421.15s] And that is beautiful.
[3421.15s - 3421.79s] Yeah.
[3421.79s - 3422.75s] That is abundant.
[3422.75s - 3423.07s] Yeah.
[3423.07s - 3428.75s] And that's something that definitely doesn't change with the financial change.
[3428.75s - 3431.07s] If I have no money right now,
[3431.07s - 3433.15s] how can I get to a place where you were at,
[3433.15s - 3435.55s] where I had the richest, most abundant life?
[3435.55s - 3437.39s] Because I was working on me.
[3437.39s - 3438.27s] I was a giver.
[3438.27s - 3441.07s] I was generous with my time and my energy and my resources,
[3441.07s - 3442.67s] with whatever I had.
[3442.67s - 3444.83s] And then how can I start to earn more money,
[3444.83s - 3449.31s] make money easy by feeling effortless internally,
[3449.39s - 3454.03s] expanding my nervous system so that it can receive more and feel safe?
[3455.15s - 3456.83s] That is a rich, abundant life.
[3456.83s - 3459.23s] And that's what we're all really looking for.
[3459.23s - 3462.59s] And me and you both know people who have hundreds of million dollars
[3462.59s - 3465.07s] that they've exited companies and they're not happy.
[3465.63s - 3469.31s] It doesn't mean having more money equals happiness.
[3469.31s - 3471.15s] You still have to learn how to heal you
[3471.15s - 3473.47s] and have a healthy relationship with yourself and money,
[3474.03s - 3475.07s] even when you have it.
[3475.07s - 3478.75s] When you're looking for a quick fix and a quick win,
[3479.74s - 3482.62s] the problem is the speed at which you win
[3482.62s - 3483.98s] is the speed at which you lose.
[3483.98s - 3484.54s] Yes.
[3484.54s - 3484.86s] Right?
[3484.86s - 3486.94s] So if you think, I'll put money into this now,
[3486.94s - 3488.30s] I'll make something in a week.
[3488.30s - 3490.78s] Chances are, like you said, you lose it immediately.
[3490.78s - 3491.66s] You lose it in a day.
[3491.66s - 3492.54s] You lose it in a day.
[3493.26s - 3495.58s] And the reason that happens is because
[3496.54s - 3499.34s] you actually don't know why you're putting your money there.
[3499.34s - 3501.66s] So it goes back to your first point of awareness.
[3501.66s - 3504.70s] It goes back to something you call the mapping habit, the plan.
[3505.42s - 3507.82s] Because what's going on is you're saying,
[3507.82s - 3508.78s] I want this to happen now.
[3508.78s - 3509.82s] I want this to happen immediately.
[3509.82s - 3511.50s] I want this to happen quickly.
[3511.50s - 3514.06s] So I know zero about this crypto.
[3514.06s - 3516.38s] I know zero about this property.
[3516.38s - 3520.38s] I've had friends literally gamble away their life savings
[3520.38s - 3521.58s] because they heard all their friends
[3521.58s - 3523.10s] were making money through crypto.
[3523.10s - 3523.82s] Or real estate or whatever.
[3523.82s - 3524.70s] When people say to me,
[3524.70s - 3525.50s] I've got this one funny.
[3525.50s - 3526.30s] What should I invest in?
[3526.30s - 3527.82s] I'm like, what do you know about?
[3527.82s - 3528.54s] Invest in that.
[3528.54s - 3530.46s] What do you actually know about?
[3530.46s - 3532.86s] What do you actually have experience, knowledge,
[3532.86s - 3533.34s] wisdom in?
[3533.34s - 3534.30s] Because guess what?
[3534.30s - 3536.30s] Because of that, you'll make money on it.
[3536.30s - 3538.22s] Because you actually understand it.
[3538.22s - 3539.98s] Again, it goes back to the point of respect.
[3539.98s - 3542.62s] If we don't respect our audience, it doesn't grow.
[3542.62s - 3544.46s] If you don't respect your community, it doesn't grow.
[3544.46s - 3546.54s] If you don't respect your clients, it doesn't grow.
[3547.10s - 3548.70s] By us saying, I want to make money,
[3548.70s - 3550.86s] but I know nothing about this industry.
[3550.86s - 3553.42s] It means I'm disrespecting the industry.
[3553.42s - 3554.86s] And sure, there may be one person
[3554.86s - 3557.18s] who had some lucky story that they tell you about.
[3557.18s - 3559.58s] But the truth is most of us are not going to get there.
[3559.58s - 3561.10s] So if you have a little bit of money,
[3561.10s - 3563.02s] and you're like, Jay, I've only got $100 to invest.
[3563.02s - 3564.94s] Lewis, I've only got $1,000 to invest.
[3564.94s - 3566.54s] And you ask me, where to put it?
[3566.54s - 3568.06s] Put it in what you know.
[3568.06s - 3570.46s] Put it in yourself, if that's all you know
[3570.46s - 3572.14s] is yourself and your skills.
[3572.14s - 3574.94s] And I think so many of us are looking for that ticket.
[3574.94s - 3576.62s] But actually, that investment in yourself
[3576.62s - 3578.30s] will pay so many dividends.
[3578.30s - 3580.62s] This is, I'm glad you said this, because a week ago,
[3580.62s - 3583.74s] someone literally asked me if I have $1,000 right now
[3583.74s - 3585.34s] to invest, where should I invest it?
[3585.34s - 3587.10s] And everyone says, put it in crypto,
[3587.10s - 3589.26s] put it in real estate funds, put it in all these things.
[3589.90s - 3591.18s] Don't listen to any of that.
[3591.18s - 3594.38s] When I had no money, there was two things that I needed
[3594.38s - 3597.02s] to create more of a currency within me.
[3597.02s - 3598.86s] And that was courage and confidence.
[3599.50s - 3602.06s] I lacked the courage to develop certain skills.
[3602.62s - 3605.90s] When I had courage to go all in on learning public speaking
[3605.90s - 3608.78s] or learning how to write, I didn't know those skills.
[3608.78s - 3610.78s] I actually lacked those skills.
[3610.78s - 3613.50s] And I was afraid to be a failure at those things
[3613.50s - 3614.54s] by trying them.
[3614.54s - 3617.18s] But by having the courage to invest my time and energy
[3617.18s - 3619.66s] in a public speaking class, in a writing coach,
[3620.22s - 3623.10s] I didn't have the skills, but I developed the courage
[3623.10s - 3625.98s] that courage created the actions to create confidence.
[3626.62s - 3630.70s] That confidence created a currency within me of belief,
[3631.34s - 3635.10s] that belief dictated my behaviors to start charging more,
[3635.10s - 3637.66s] to go out there and ask for more, to put myself out there
[3637.66s - 3638.38s] in bigger ways.
[3638.94s - 3641.66s] And so if you have $1,000 or $5,000 right now
[3641.66s - 3643.50s] and you want to figure out where to invest it,
[3643.50s - 3645.90s] invest it in courage to learn new skills
[3645.90s - 3647.58s] that will give you confidence,
[3647.58s - 3650.86s] that will be an incredible currency that you'll have forever.
[3650.86s - 3653.58s] I mean, Lewis, I'm so excited for people to read this book.
[3653.58s - 3655.98s] It's honestly, I love this conversation
[3655.98s - 3658.38s] because we're both sitting here as people who,
[3659.10s - 3661.74s] like you said, not finished our money journey either.
[3661.74s - 3663.98s] We're, you know, I've got so many years left
[3663.98s - 3664.86s] to learn so much more.
[3665.42s - 3669.42s] The reason why I empathize with it is I never ever thought
[3669.42s - 3672.86s] I'd be financially abundant mentally or physically.
[3672.86s - 3674.14s] And I know you feel the same way.
[3674.14s - 3674.70s] Dude, I was-
[3674.70s - 3676.70s] I thought you would never figure out how to make money.
[3676.70s - 3677.18s] Same.
[3677.18s - 3679.42s] I really empathize with everyone who's listening going,
[3679.42s - 3681.58s] I'm stuck. I'm trying to figure this out.
[3681.58s - 3683.66s] But I really do believe it starts with this
[3684.38s - 3686.62s] because this is the work you'll have to do,
[3687.42s - 3689.82s] whether you make money tomorrow or in 10 years.
[3689.82s - 3690.78s] And no matter how much you make,
[3690.78s - 3694.14s] you're still going to have to do this work in this book
[3694.14s - 3696.70s] because even if you find a way to make money
[3696.70s - 3698.78s] and you become really, really financially successful,
[3699.34s - 3701.58s] you will never feel free in that financial success
[3701.58s - 3702.94s] without doing this work.
[3702.94s - 3705.98s] And you'll still feel anxious and you'll still feel stressed
[3705.98s - 3708.78s] and you'll still feel all of that, right?
[3708.78s - 3710.22s] I tell a story in the book about,
[3710.22s - 3713.58s] I used to live in an apartment building here in LA.
[3713.58s - 3714.38s] It was really sad.
[3714.38s - 3715.98s] There was a lot of wealthy people in this building
[3715.98s - 3719.18s] that I lived in, a lot of celebrities and billionaires.
[3719.18s - 3721.82s] I was the poorest person there, which is another lesson,
[3721.82s - 3725.18s] which is to put yourself in rooms where you can master mine
[3725.18s - 3728.70s] with people and be around proximity of people who have more
[3728.70s - 3729.58s] so you can learn from them.
[3729.58s - 3732.30s] But I was on a trip and I came back from a trip
[3732.30s - 3735.18s] driving back into the valet of my building.
[3735.90s - 3739.66s] And there was a tent in the valet in the driveway.
[3740.22s - 3742.54s] And I kind of jokingly said to the valet attendant
[3742.54s - 3743.98s] as I pulled into the building, I said,
[3744.62s - 3746.78s] someone didn't jump today, kind of like joking.
[3747.42s - 3749.26s] And the guy looked at me with a serious face,
[3749.26s - 3751.26s] like, yeah, it just happened like 30 minutes ago.
[3751.26s - 3753.98s] And I was like, this can't be real.
[3753.98s - 3754.78s] It was like, what?
[3755.34s - 3756.62s] There's billionaires in here.
[3756.62s - 3757.50s] There's millionaires in here.
[3757.50s - 3758.46s] There's celebrities in here.
[3758.46s - 3761.42s] I was like, why would anyone in this building
[3761.42s - 3762.30s] take their own life?
[3763.18s - 3765.42s] And it was kind of like just this shock to me
[3765.42s - 3769.02s] because I learned later who this person was.
[3769.02s - 3771.82s] Someone did jump off the building right before I came back.
[3772.54s - 3774.86s] And he was worth hundreds of millions of dollars,
[3774.86s - 3775.58s] net worth.
[3775.58s - 3777.10s] You just Googled his name.
[3777.10s - 3778.78s] And I was just thinking, why would someone
[3778.78s - 3780.94s] worth so much money take their life?
[3781.82s - 3784.78s] And I don't want to assume what really happened,
[3784.78s - 3787.98s] but it doesn't mean having all the money in the world
[3787.98s - 3789.26s] is going to solve all your problems
[3789.26s - 3791.82s] and you're going to feel like you can love and accept yourself.
[3791.90s - 3793.42s] That you have self-worth.
[3793.42s - 3796.14s] So like you said, you may learn how to make a lot of money,
[3796.14s - 3797.98s] but if you haven't learned how to heal your relationship
[3797.98s - 3800.62s] with you, then all the money in the world
[3800.62s - 3803.98s] can't save your life and can't make you feel rich,
[3803.98s - 3805.34s] can't make you feel abundant,
[3805.34s - 3807.10s] can't make you have beautiful relationships
[3807.10s - 3809.18s] with friends, family, colleagues.
[3809.74s - 3811.90s] And that's where the real wealth comes in life
[3811.90s - 3813.90s] when you have deep meaningful relationships.
[3814.54s - 3817.10s] And something I want to acknowledge that you do really well
[3817.82s - 3820.46s] is you follow this first habit,
[3821.02s - 3825.42s] the mindset habit so well, which is how can I be generous
[3825.42s - 3828.70s] with my time, my energy, my love for friends, family,
[3828.70s - 3830.38s] colleagues, your community.
[3831.10s - 3832.62s] This community feels it.
[3832.62s - 3834.30s] Everyone listening and watching right now
[3834.30s - 3837.66s] feel your generosity, your giving hearts,
[3837.66s - 3839.74s] and your gratitude for them,
[3839.74s - 3843.02s] whether it be individually or collectively, they feel it.
[3843.66s - 3846.46s] And most people, they want to make more money,
[3847.02s - 3849.18s] but they don't have that generosity,
[3849.18s - 3854.30s] that grateful spirit, and they want the quick fix.
[3854.30s - 3858.54s] They want to make easy money quick, not make money easy.
[3859.50s - 3861.58s] And the billionaires that I know you know,
[3862.30s - 3864.62s] and the millionaires that we know we've interviewed,
[3865.42s - 3866.94s] and I'll ask them this question,
[3866.94s - 3869.26s] what do you think the key to creating more
[3869.26s - 3872.46s] financial abundance every year after year is for you?
[3872.46s - 3874.78s] Every billionaire or mega millionaire
[3874.78s - 3876.70s] will say giving more.
[3876.70s - 3879.58s] I make more when I give more that year,
[3880.30s - 3882.06s] whether it be giving more to charities,
[3882.06s - 3883.74s] whether it be giving to people in my life,
[3883.74s - 3885.42s] whether it be giving back to my community,
[3885.42s - 3887.90s] giving back to my employees, my business,
[3887.90s - 3889.50s] finding ways to give more,
[3889.50s - 3891.98s] and almost give where it feels a little uncomfortable.
[3891.98s - 3895.26s] Like, oh, that was a big check I just wrote.
[3895.26s - 3898.30s] Oh, man, I care about this cause, this charity.
[3899.58s - 3901.18s] I feel safe giving this amount,
[3901.18s - 3905.10s] but what really would make it uncomfortable?
[3905.10s - 3907.58s] Or I go to church every week and I typically give this,
[3907.58s - 3909.74s] but what would make me feel a little uncomfortable?
[3910.38s - 3912.62s] Most of these people say the more they give,
[3912.62s - 3914.06s] when it's the most uncomfortable,
[3915.14s - 3917.22s] somehow they just keep earning more.
[3917.22s - 3919.46s] And I'm not saying you should give all your money away
[3919.46s - 3920.90s] and you're going to earn more back,
[3921.70s - 3923.62s] but having that mindset of generosity,
[3923.62s - 3926.66s] and you do this very well, where you give to your community,
[3926.66s - 3929.30s] whenever there's some type of breakdown in the world,
[3929.30s - 3932.26s] you're one of the first people to say, how can we give?
[3932.26s - 3933.78s] How can we rally the troops?
[3933.86s - 3937.46s] You give first, you rally the troops, they let's give back,
[3937.46s - 3940.74s] the fires happened, stuff happened in India a couple years ago,
[3940.74s - 3944.02s] stuff's always happening and you say, we're going to give.
[3944.02s - 3946.50s] I don't know if that seems something conscious you think about,
[3946.50s - 3950.66s] like, oh, by giving more every year, it helps me make more,
[3950.66s - 3952.90s] but also I feel richer.
[3952.90s - 3955.22s] And when you do that with everyone in your life,
[3955.94s - 3960.02s] whether you're the hostess and you give curiosity, love,
[3960.02s - 3962.42s] passion, fun, playfulness,
[3962.42s - 3963.86s] you're giving something in that moment.
[3964.50s - 3968.10s] If you can write a check for something that is a cause
[3968.10s - 3971.38s] and you give, it's because you can and you do it generously.
[3972.18s - 3974.74s] It's just going to make you richer inside
[3974.74s - 3978.34s] and you're creating an energy of abundance to attract more.
[3978.34s - 3980.74s] I think for me, it was watching my parents.
[3980.74s - 3984.10s] So for all the other things I said about just enough and everything,
[3984.10s - 3986.26s] my parents always gave in charity.
[3986.82s - 3990.02s] Our home was always a home where everyone was welcome.
[3990.10s - 3992.90s] My mom would happily cook dinner for everyone,
[3992.90s - 3994.90s] even though we didn't have everything.
[3995.62s - 3999.14s] And so my parents had this generous heart at the same time.
[3999.14s - 4001.30s] They probably felt rich in that.
[4001.30s - 4001.94s] For sure.
[4001.94s - 4002.90s] Generously.
[4002.90s - 4004.98s] And they did it when we didn't have a lot.
[4005.62s - 4007.54s] Now when I realize how much my parents made
[4007.54s - 4010.74s] and how much they gave in charity, the proportions were pretty off.
[4011.54s - 4015.78s] And I think for me, I just felt so fortunate and I feel so lucky
[4015.78s - 4019.86s] and I feel so grateful that I have been able to find abundance in my life.
[4020.26s - 4024.98s] That I feel like the only natural reaction to that has to be to give.
[4025.54s - 4028.82s] When I came back to LA with the fires and everything,
[4028.82s - 4030.98s] I was just grateful to come back to our home.
[4030.98s - 4033.46s] But not everyone I know came back to a home.
[4034.02s - 4037.54s] And so I felt grateful that I had a home.
[4037.54s - 4039.30s] And so I was like, okay, what can we do?
[4039.30s - 4041.54s] And so I think it comes from a place of gratitude again.
[4041.54s - 4044.42s] It comes from a place of seeing my parents be so generous,
[4044.42s - 4046.58s] even though they had nothing to give actually.
[4047.30s - 4050.74s] And it ultimately comes to me because I just feel like
[4051.38s - 4054.90s] there's no better use for it in the long run than that.
[4054.90s - 4056.74s] And I do believe it will come back in its own way.
[4056.74s - 4058.18s] I don't give it because I want it back.
[4058.18s - 4060.74s] I give it because I believe there's a need.
[4060.74s - 4064.74s] But I do deeply believe that it will come back in its own way and it always has.
[4064.74s - 4066.26s] The books called Make Money Easy,
[4066.82s - 4070.58s] Create Financial Freedom and Live a Richer Life, Lewis House.
[4070.58s - 4072.74s] Lewis, I'm so grateful genuinely for this conversation.
[4072.74s - 4074.50s] It's let me feeling so rich.
[4074.50s - 4076.42s] I've always felt rich in our friendship.
[4076.42s - 4078.58s] And I'm really glad that you wrote about it in this way
[4078.58s - 4081.46s] because I think there's lots of great money experts out there
[4081.46s - 4084.82s] who are agreeing really good sound financial advice.
[4084.82s - 4087.38s] Yeah, that's not what this is.
[4087.38s - 4089.14s] And I think we need all of it.
[4089.14s - 4092.02s] But I think this is a deep part because I know for me personally,
[4092.66s - 4096.18s] this has been really deep work and you put it into a book.
[4096.18s - 4098.18s] And so I'm so grateful that people get to access it.
[4098.18s - 4098.74s] Thanks, brother.
[4098.74s - 4099.54s] Thank you for doing this.
[4099.54s - 4103.54s] Everyone who's been listening or watching, read the book, learn the habits,
[4103.54s - 4106.10s] tag me and Lewis on Instagram on TikTok.
[4106.10s - 4108.82s] Let me know what's resonating with you, what's connected with you.
[4108.82s - 4110.18s] I want to hear your stories.
[4110.18s - 4112.02s] I want to hear what skill you invested in.
[4112.02s - 4113.38s] I want you to turn up at your job.
[4113.38s - 4115.86s] Even if you hate it, I want you to turn up to it
[4115.86s - 4118.50s] with all the love that you possibly have.
[4118.50s - 4121.86s] See whose mind you blow, who gets impressed by what you're doing.
[4121.86s - 4125.22s] Someone's going to be able to shift your life at some point.
[4125.22s - 4127.30s] And it's going to start with you.
[4127.30s - 4131.70s] But just don't underestimate the value of these things that sound simple.
[4131.70s - 4134.66s] And they sound like I've got to figure out something more complex.
[4134.66s - 4135.14s] No, no, no.
[4135.14s - 4136.82s] This is where it starts.
[4136.82s - 4139.06s] And this will mean that at the end of it, you'll be happy.
[4139.06s - 4140.90s] So thank you to Lewis.
[4140.90s - 4142.50s] Thank you to each and every one of you.
[4142.50s - 4143.62s] And yeah, make money easy.
[4143.62s - 4144.18s] Appreciate it, brother.
[4144.18s - 4144.82s] Make money easy.
[4144.82s - 4145.54s] I love you, right?
[4145.54s - 4150.18s] If you love this episode, you'll love my conversation with Dr. Joe Dispenza
[4150.18s - 4154.74s] on why stress and overthinking negatively impacts your brain and heart
[4154.74s - 4158.02s] and how to change your habits that are on autopilot.
[4158.02s - 4159.62s] Listen to it right now.
[4159.62s - 4164.90s] How many times do we have to forget until we stop forgetting and start remembering?
[4164.90s - 4166.18s] That's the moment of change.
[4166.18s - 4168.66s] No one cares how many times you fell off the bicycle.
[4168.66s - 4170.90s] If you ride the bicycle now, you ride the bike.
