[0.00s - 5.00s] If your happiness depends on the actions of others,
[5.16s - 8.48s] you're at mercy of things that you can't control.
[8.48s - 9.92s] The best-selling author and host.
[9.92s - 12.20s] The number one health and wellness podcast.
[12.20s - 13.64s] On purpose with Jay Shetty.
[15.50s - 16.74s] Yeah, I'm not even just saying this.
[16.74s - 20.14s] I literally think I manifested this.
[20.14s - 24.10s] After I saw you at Simi and Hayes' house,
[24.10s - 27.30s] so that was a couple months ago and then a few weeks ago,
[27.30s - 29.10s] I was talking to my social media girl randomly,
[29.14s - 31.26s] we were just talking about a bunch of stuff
[31.26s - 34.58s] and just kind of what I would love to represent
[34.58s - 36.98s] and just talking about a new chapter for me and whatever.
[36.98s - 38.82s] And I was, she was like,
[38.82s - 40.82s] who would you really want to like talk to or whatever?
[40.82s - 42.74s] And I was like, it'd be so cool to talk to Jay.
[42.74s - 44.90s] And she was like, that would be really cool.
[44.90s - 46.86s] And then we kind of just, that was kind of the thought
[46.86s - 48.34s] and whatever, and then you hit me.
[48.34s - 51.46s] And I was like, no fricking way he's hitting me right now.
[51.46s - 52.90s] So I was like, absolutely.
[52.90s - 53.90s] This is like perfect.
[53.90s - 56.10s] It's the universe just putting it in perfect timing.
[56.58s - 58.98s] That makes me so happy because it was exactly
[58.98s - 60.06s] the opposite way.
[60.06s - 62.98s] So I've for a long time had people
[62.98s - 64.02s] that I'd love to sit down with.
[64.02s - 65.46s] And every time I saw you do something
[65.46s - 68.30s] with mental health and Vogue or any of the segments
[68.30s - 70.38s] that you ever did, I was just like, she's amazing.
[70.38s - 72.06s] Like, you know, it's incredible to,
[72.06s - 74.58s] the way you were talking about it when you'd post about it,
[74.58s - 75.94s] I'd be like, oh, this is incredible.
[75.94s - 78.22s] Like to see you speaking so openly about it
[78.22s - 79.46s] and vulnerability about it.
[79.46s - 81.82s] And so I've always wanted to do this.
[81.82s - 84.50s] And then, but we've never really crossed paths.
[84.50s - 85.74s] So I'm always just a bit like,
[85.74s - 87.54s] and I don't like asking friends of friends
[87.54s - 88.62s] when I haven't met someone.
[88.62s - 90.94s] And so I was like, that day I had to like,
[90.94s - 91.78s] pluck up the courage.
[91.78s - 93.58s] I'm just gonna ask it myself.
[93.58s - 95.38s] Cause it's easier when I ask directly.
[95.38s - 96.58s] And I know Christie, so.
[96.58s - 97.42s] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[97.42s - 99.22s] But I was like, it's nicer when there's,
[99.22s - 100.30s] I told my team too, I was like,
[100.30s - 102.26s] it's so much nicer when there's like a personal connection.
[102.26s - 103.10s] For sure.
[103.10s - 104.74s] And someone really feels comfortable
[104.74s - 105.94s] rather than it's like a PR thing.
[105.94s - 107.86s] No, it was, it was so perfect.
[107.86s - 109.14s] Like when I think back to it, I'm like,
[109.14s - 111.78s] that was me just trusting the universe
[111.78s - 113.30s] and not pushing for anything.
[113.30s - 115.10s] And I knew it was gonna kind of happen
[115.14s - 116.06s] when it was supposed to.
[116.06s - 116.90s] And it literally did.
[116.90s - 117.74s] And it did, yeah.
[117.74s - 118.58s] You felt it too.
[118.58s - 119.42s] Yeah, I did.
[119.42s - 120.26s] That means you worked with me.
[120.26s - 121.70s] Yeah, and I hope that this is the start
[121.70s - 123.14s] of spending more time together.
[123.14s - 123.98s] Me too, me too.
[123.98s - 125.42s] Yeah, off camera too.
[125.42s - 126.26s] I would love that.
[126.26s - 128.74s] Cause like, I think also, I don't know.
[128.74s - 130.50s] Like I admire people like you.
[130.50s - 134.66s] I admire like, you know, the, the Michael Pollans
[134.66s - 136.98s] and Michael Singers and Wim Hofs of the world.
[136.98s - 139.10s] And I feel like you fit in that category for me
[139.10s - 140.90s] of just people that are, cause you know,
[140.90s - 142.22s] I know a little bit about your story.
[142.22s - 143.46s] I'd like to actually know more,
[143.46s - 144.82s] which would be really cool to actually,
[144.82s - 147.94s] I know we're obviously not here for that exactly.
[147.94s - 149.62s] But for me, just personally,
[149.62s - 151.46s] like I'd love to know more of your story.
[151.46s - 154.70s] I know that you've had quite the experiences.
[154.70s - 156.46s] And I think that's so cool.
[156.46s - 157.90s] I'm like so intrigued by people
[157.90s - 159.74s] with just that amount of curiosity
[159.74s - 163.06s] and like determination and patience.
[163.06s - 166.22s] Like that takes so much patience to be like you
[166.22s - 168.30s] or like any of those people that I just listed,
[168.30s - 169.14s] it's so cool to me.
[169.14s - 171.70s] And I just, I wish, I wish for myself,
[171.70s - 172.66s] but I'm working on it.
[172.66s - 174.10s] No, you're that curious too.
[174.74s - 177.66s] I am, it's just, you know, that level of,
[177.66s - 181.14s] like I said, patience and determination is like,
[181.14s - 182.14s] it's a gift.
[182.14s - 184.98s] Like that is like a really, really amazing gift.
[184.98s - 188.18s] And like I said, like I'm just working on it all the time.
[188.18s - 190.58s] And that's my goal in life, I guess.
[190.58s - 194.14s] Well, I think I feel the same way about you again that,
[194.14s - 195.30s] and by the way, I love all those people
[195.30s - 196.14s] you just mentioned too.
[196.14s - 199.02s] So feel very honored to be put into that group of people.
[199.02s - 200.70s] And we've had Wim on the podcast before too,
[200.70s - 201.54s] so he's been a guest.
[201.54s - 204.06s] But with you, I feel the same way back
[204.06s - 207.30s] when it's like, when you see someone who is so curious,
[207.30s - 210.02s] who could get away with not worrying about these things
[210.02s - 210.86s] if you don't want to,
[210.86s - 212.26s] but then still being courageous enough
[212.26s - 213.30s] to talk about these things
[213.30s - 215.06s] and then using your platform as a space
[215.06s - 216.26s] to open up these dialogues.
[216.26s - 220.70s] Like that is as, if not more important as well
[220.70s - 222.66s] as doing the work and doing the path.
[222.66s - 223.50s] Yeah.
[223.50s - 224.46s] I can see you doing the work.
[224.46s - 226.58s] It's fun watching you do the work and figuring it out.
[226.58s - 228.26s] I love working on myself.
[228.26s - 231.46s] Like it is actually like a passion of mine.
[231.58s - 235.38s] And I just, I find so much comfort and joy
[235.38s - 239.58s] in like actually finding where I think I could better myself
[239.58s - 241.14s] and being like, even if it's physical,
[241.14s - 243.30s] like physical as in like my physical health
[243.30s - 245.58s] or working out or I just started doing,
[245.58s - 246.46s] speaking of Wim Hof,
[246.46s - 248.74s] I just started doing like cold plunges and ice baths
[248.74s - 250.86s] and like, even if I don't have the time to go outside
[250.86s - 251.86s] and I just got a cold plunge,
[251.86s - 253.38s] I did it right before I got here.
[253.38s - 254.22s] It's the best thing ever.
[254.22s - 255.38s] I do this again.
[255.38s - 258.06s] Again, it takes so much mental,
[258.06s - 259.58s] the whole thing of it is all mental.
[259.58s - 262.58s] So I don't know, just stuff like that I really love.
[262.58s - 265.74s] So I'm always, I'm always trying to just be
[265.74s - 267.14s] the best version of me.
[267.14s - 268.70s] And so I just love that.
[268.70s - 270.58s] It like actually makes me feel really good.
[270.58s - 272.54s] I love self-care and I just love stuff like that.
[272.54s - 273.94s] So it's been really cool,
[273.94s - 278.02s] but it's cool for you to say that you enjoy seeing that
[278.02s - 281.34s] from me because there's always been kind of this weird part
[281.34s - 282.66s] of it for me where I'm like,
[282.66s - 283.98s] is this a pity party?
[283.98s - 285.14s] Cause I don't want it to be.
[285.14s - 288.30s] Like I want this to feel very positive.
[288.30s - 289.66s] I want to connect with people.
[289.66s - 292.30s] And I guess that's, that is my goal there is to be like,
[292.30s - 294.22s] there actually is this side of me that you might,
[294.22s - 295.86s] may not know of,
[295.86s - 298.66s] but the goal here is to connect
[298.66s - 302.86s] and also not feel like I'm throwing some pity party
[302.86s - 305.38s] for myself because I want this to be a learning experience
[305.38s - 306.22s] for everyone.
[306.22s - 307.58s] I want this to be really positive
[307.58s - 308.90s] and really, really well received.
[308.90s - 309.74s] I want you to look at it
[309.74s - 312.18s] and actually have a positive feeling towards it.
[312.18s - 314.58s] So I don't know, you'll find like if I, you know,
[314.58s - 316.46s] when I do kind of post about something
[316.50s - 318.34s] or when I want to talk about something,
[318.34s - 319.70s] I'm usually sharing a tip
[319.70s - 322.18s] or like sharing kind of like a little technique,
[322.18s - 323.70s] even if it's something so simple
[323.70s - 324.90s] as like walking outside,
[324.90s - 326.30s] taking a few deep breaths and journaling,
[326.30s - 330.38s] like it's just that kind of stuff that I really like
[330.38s - 333.26s] to share cause I feel like I want to be helpful
[333.26s - 334.10s] more than anything.
[334.10s - 336.06s] And that's how, that's at least how I see it.
[336.06s - 338.42s] Like I see it not, not completely,
[338.42s - 339.82s] not as a pity party at all,
[339.82s - 341.38s] but so much more as just,
[341.38s - 343.50s] Hey, here's a reminder of something that I did.
[343.50s - 346.26s] And I feel like that positivity shines
[346.26s - 347.58s] through too in the way you do it.
[347.58s - 349.06s] So at least if that helps,
[349.06s - 351.58s] whatever that's worth from the outside,
[351.58s - 353.06s] it definitely comes across that way.
[353.06s - 356.02s] And this is easily even the warmest introduction
[356.02s - 358.26s] to a flow of a conversation I've ever experienced
[358.26s - 359.10s] in my entire life.
[359.10s - 360.62s] I was gonna say, I was actually,
[360.62s - 362.58s] I was actually really nervous coming in here
[362.58s - 364.30s] cause this means so much to me.
[364.30s - 366.14s] Like, and I'm serious cause you know,
[366.14s - 368.26s] I've done a lot of interviews in my life
[368.26s - 370.66s] and when thinking about this one
[370.66s - 371.90s] or thinking about that I even wanted
[371.90s - 373.66s] to do something like this,
[373.66s - 375.34s] it just, it means a lot to me.
[375.34s - 377.30s] And so it made me a little nervous.
[377.30s - 378.90s] And I was like, I just want to get this right.
[378.90s - 379.74s] This isn't like, you know,
[379.74s - 381.42s] me going out and promoting something
[381.42s - 382.50s] or talking about something.
[382.50s - 384.86s] This is, you know, something very real
[384.86s - 386.66s] that we all experience,
[386.66s - 389.22s] which is just, you know, ourselves
[389.22s - 391.42s] and our wellbeing and just everything.
[391.42s - 392.26s] So yeah.
[392.26s - 393.82s] And this is, this is a, you know,
[393.82s - 396.06s] for me genuinely, and I really do mean this,
[396.06s - 399.90s] like the podcast has been a great excuse
[399.90s - 402.02s] or really from my side and intention
[402.02s - 404.30s] to get to know people I really admire.
[404.30s - 406.10s] And so for me, it's been a great way
[406.10s - 408.22s] of building new friendships and relationships
[408.22s - 409.38s] because if you can sit and talk to someone
[409.38s - 410.94s] and really get along with each other,
[410.94s - 412.50s] you're like, oh, we should do this more often.
[412.50s - 413.34s] So.
[413.34s - 414.18s] Well, I'm honored.
[414.18s - 415.54s] Yeah. So for me, it's definitely been that.
[415.54s - 418.82s] And to me, you know, you saying that
[418.82s - 421.26s] and you know, taking it as intentionally as you are,
[421.26s - 423.10s] it's, you know, for me, it's as important.
[423.10s - 425.86s] I always shared this before we start recording usually,
[425.86s - 427.62s] but we just flowed.
[427.62s - 430.06s] Hey everyone, welcome back to On Purpose,
[430.06s - 432.18s] the number one health podcast in the world.
[432.18s - 433.90s] Thanks to each and every single one of you
[433.90s - 437.38s] that come back every week to listen, learn and grow.
[437.38s - 439.34s] Now it's very rare that I get to sit down with someone
[439.34s - 442.30s] that I have admired for a very long time from afar,
[442.30s - 444.38s] someone that I believe has inspired me
[444.38s - 446.30s] through the sharing of their story,
[446.30s - 448.42s] someone who speaks so vulnerably and openly
[448.42s - 450.02s] about the things that I most care about,
[450.02s - 453.10s] mental health, purpose, the journey of life
[453.10s - 455.22s] and discovery and curiosity.
[455.22s - 457.50s] And what I want to share about this person
[457.50s - 459.98s] is when I bumped into them at a mutual friend's birthday party
[459.98s - 462.14s] and I just want to give a big shout out to Simeon Hayes
[462.14s - 463.26s] because this wouldn't happen.
[463.26s - 464.54s] Without them, I love you Simeon Hayes,
[464.54s - 467.86s] you've been amazing guests on the podcast before as well.
[467.86s - 469.38s] I wouldn't have bumped into this individual
[469.38s - 471.26s] and had this opportunity to reach out to them.
[471.26s - 473.02s] And as soon as I reached out,
[473.02s - 476.46s] this has been the most flowing conversation and connection
[476.46s - 478.46s] that I've possibly had on the podcast to be honest.
[478.46s - 479.86s] So I just want to put that out.
[479.86s - 481.06s] I'm speaking about the one and only,
[481.06s - 482.78s] someone who needs no introduction,
[482.78s - 486.70s] but successful business founder, international supermodel,
[486.70s - 489.94s] founder of the incredibly successful Tequila brand 818
[489.98s - 492.70s] and star on the Hulu's, The Kardashians,
[492.70s - 496.22s] which premieres in second season on September 22nd,
[496.22s - 498.06s] the one and only Kendall Jenner.
[498.06s - 500.22s] Kendall, thank you so much for doing this.
[500.22s - 501.06s] Thanks for having me.
[501.06s - 502.78s] That was a wonderful introduction.
[502.78s - 505.30s] Oh, well, it's honest being such an honor
[505.30s - 507.50s] getting to know someone who,
[507.50s - 510.86s] it's very rare that I find someone who functions
[510.86s - 514.62s] with very similar values in a personal connection sense.
[514.62s - 516.82s] So when I reached out to you,
[516.82s - 518.38s] I really meant everything I said
[518.38s - 519.42s] and I could have written you an essay,
[519.42s - 521.74s] but I was like, let's spare the details.
[521.74s - 524.78s] And then to get your response and then for us to be here
[524.78s - 526.78s] within a couple of weeks of connecting
[526.78s - 528.02s] and even your message this morning,
[528.02s - 529.82s] I just want people to know, I was like,
[529.82s - 531.26s] the text you sent me this morning,
[531.26s - 533.26s] I was like, this never happens.
[533.26s - 534.98s] Like I was like, this is amazing.
[534.98s - 536.54s] And I was literally gonna do the same thing.
[536.54s - 538.74s] And so to me, I was like, this is very rare.
[538.74s - 541.66s] And so I love the synergy and the flow that we're experiencing
[541.66s - 544.30s] and I'm excited to get into it now.
[544.30s - 547.78s] It's funny cause I called Hayes before the other day
[547.78s - 548.94s] and I was just like, oh my God,
[548.94s - 550.94s] I'm going on your friend's show and whatever.
[550.94s - 553.02s] And she was like, he's the best.
[553.02s - 553.86s] It's good.
[553.86s - 554.82s] You're just gonna flow right into it.
[554.82s - 555.94s] He's so easy to talk to.
[555.94s - 557.50s] And that's literally what happened.
[557.50s - 559.90s] And like I told you, I just feel like I manifested
[559.90s - 562.42s] this moment for both of us and for this,
[562.42s - 563.70s] just this whole experience.
[563.70s - 565.94s] And so I am really happy to be here.
[565.94s - 566.98s] And I'm honestly honored.
[566.98s - 568.98s] Like I said, I admire you and I,
[568.98s - 571.10s] there's so many people like you that I admire.
[571.10s - 574.46s] So I think sitting down here with you is just so cool for me
[574.46s - 576.94s] and I get to talk about fun things with you.
[577.42s - 578.50s] Amazing, first of many.
[578.50s - 580.10s] And I wanted to start with,
[580.10s - 581.90s] because I always like to start with just things
[581.90s - 582.94s] that I've seen more recently.
[582.94s - 585.30s] A couple of days ago, I think you posted a beautiful picture
[585.30s - 587.54s] of you hugging your horse and you were like,
[587.54s - 589.30s] you know, like snuggle time or something like that.
[589.30s - 592.26s] And I was just like, when did horses become a part
[592.26s - 595.18s] of your life and how did you get so close to them?
[595.18s - 598.10s] I think I've spent many lifetimes with horses.
[598.10s - 601.94s] I think this is very, one of many lifetimes that I've had.
[601.94s - 603.42s] I grew up in a horse community.
[603.42s - 605.82s] So where we grew up, horses everywhere,
[605.82s - 608.34s] more trails than there were homes really.
[608.34s - 610.50s] And so I was always around horses
[610.50s - 612.66s] and I just was deeply in love with them.
[612.66s - 614.10s] And I have no explanation.
[614.10s - 615.82s] And that's why I say I feel like in past lives,
[615.82s - 617.98s] I have just been around horses.
[617.98s - 620.86s] Yeah, so since I was a really young kid, loved them
[620.86s - 624.18s] and continue to love them my whole life.
[624.18s - 625.02s] They're just the best.
[625.02s - 628.46s] They're the most majestic and gorgeous
[628.46s - 631.38s] and spiritual, they feel everything.
[631.38s - 634.86s] I just like, it's such an honor to be in their presence
[634.86s - 637.38s] and to be able to do what I can do with my horse.
[637.38s - 641.02s] I find so magical that I can stand in her stall with her
[641.02s - 642.70s] and just like vibe out with her.
[642.70s - 646.30s] I like sometimes come to like a little get a little teary-eyed
[646.30s - 647.54s] when I'm standing in my stall with her.
[647.54s - 648.82s] Cause I'm like, this is so cool
[648.82s - 649.90s] that you allow me to do this
[649.90s - 651.94s] and we have this connection without any words.
[651.94s - 653.94s] It's just the best thing ever.
[653.94s - 654.90s] So I love them.
[654.90s - 655.90s] Yeah, that's so special.
[655.90s - 658.58s] I have a different teary-eyed story with horses.
[658.58s - 660.94s] But I'll tell you the short version.
[660.94s - 662.38s] So when I proposed to my wife,
[662.38s - 663.50s] who I can't wait to introduce you to,
[663.50s - 665.58s] when I proposed to her, which was eight years ago
[665.58s - 666.62s] or something like that,
[666.62s - 668.14s] when I proposed to her,
[668.14s - 670.62s] I organized a very, what I would consider
[670.62s - 672.58s] like a very Hollywood proposal.
[672.58s - 674.50s] It was too over the top
[674.50s - 676.34s] and I would do it totally different today
[676.34s - 677.82s] with all everything I've learned.
[677.82s - 678.66s] It happens.
[678.66s - 679.50s] Yeah, it happens.
[679.50s - 680.34s] It happens.
[680.34s - 682.46s] And so we were walking to buy the Thames in London,
[682.46s - 684.22s] which is where we're both born and raised
[684.22s - 685.74s] and this acapella group jumps out
[685.74s - 687.22s] and they're singing Bruno Mars.
[687.22s - 689.70s] And then like they give her a bouquet of flowers.
[689.70s - 690.98s] And then I get down on one knee.
[690.98s - 692.82s] I propose we have dinner by the river
[692.82s - 694.78s] and then we walk around the corner
[694.78s - 698.30s] and there's a horse-drawn carriage to take us around.
[698.30s - 699.14s] Okay, amazing.
[699.14s - 700.14s] To take us around London.
[700.14s - 701.22s] And so we're on this carriage.
[701.22s - 703.70s] We have this beautiful, you know, path through London.
[703.70s - 705.46s] And then we get into the train to get back home
[705.46s - 706.94s] to her parents to tell them.
[706.94s - 710.70s] And they already knew she's got hives all over her face.
[710.70s - 711.54s] No way.
[711.54s - 712.38s] And all over her heart.
[712.38s - 713.22s] She was allergic.
[713.22s - 714.06s] She's allergic to horses.
[714.06s - 714.90s] No.
[714.90s - 716.38s] And I found out the day I proposed to her.
[716.38s - 717.22s] I was like, all right.
[717.22s - 718.38s] So then she was like, she had tears.
[718.38s - 719.54s] And when we got back, her parents were like,
[719.54s - 720.38s] what did you do to her?
[720.38s - 721.70s] At least you got to enjoy the moment.
[721.70s - 722.54s] At least you got to enjoy the moment.
[723.26s - 724.58s] But no, I love horses.
[724.58s - 725.74s] Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[725.74s - 727.62s] No, I love horses the same way you do.
[727.62s - 730.22s] Like I used to go to India a lot when I was a kid.
[730.22s - 733.66s] And that's where I first learned to be with horses.
[733.66s - 734.50s] And it was-
[734.50s - 735.98s] I mean, they're so therapeutic.
[735.98s - 736.82s] Absolutely, yeah.
[736.82s - 738.62s] There's a reason there's equine therapy.
[738.62s - 739.46s] It's the best.
[739.46s - 740.30s] Exactly.
[740.30s - 741.74s] Yeah, they make me,
[741.74s - 743.94s] they make me when I'm with her.
[743.94s - 747.42s] I have a few, but I'm mostly with one of my horses right now.
[747.42s - 748.26s] What's her name?
[748.26s - 749.10s] Her name's D'Landra.
[749.10s - 750.02s] I didn't name her.
[750.02s - 751.30s] She came with her name.
[751.30s - 753.70s] But I call her Dylan or Dill.
[753.70s - 754.82s] I love her so much.
[754.82s - 756.78s] But when I'm with her, I genuinely,
[756.78s - 759.02s] I speak of like, or I spoke about how I've just
[759.02s - 760.06s] loved horses my whole life.
[760.06s - 761.86s] I feel like a kid around her.
[761.86s - 764.54s] Like I feel like my 12 year old self
[764.54s - 767.62s] that would get up every morning throughout the entire summer
[767.62s - 771.26s] at 8 a.m. to go just be at my trainer's facility.
[771.26s - 773.50s] And I would stay there from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
[773.50s - 774.98s] I'd ride all her horses.
[774.98s - 776.18s] I'd groom all her horses.
[776.18s - 777.82s] I would just sit in the stalls with all the horses.
[777.82s - 779.66s] Like anytime I'm with her,
[779.66s - 782.10s] I just have that sense of like being a child again.
[782.10s - 783.94s] And it's a really, really good feeling.
[783.94s - 786.34s] Animals have that special ability, don't they?
[786.34s - 787.18s] They're so awesome.
[787.18s - 788.74s] Whichever animal you're attracted to.
[788.74s - 790.98s] And I never thought I would.
[790.98s - 792.10s] But when I lived as a monk,
[792.10s - 795.14s] the animal that's revered in India is cows.
[795.14s - 799.46s] And you would never think of cows being like majestic
[799.46s - 801.58s] or in that way, especially when you're not in India.
[801.58s - 804.26s] But the cows in India have these like lotus-like eyes.
[804.26s - 807.34s] Like the eyes are just like absolutely stunning.
[807.34s - 808.30s] And they're so special.
[808.30s - 810.10s] And they're such gentle animals.
[810.10s - 812.74s] And recently, Radhi and I went trekking
[812.74s - 814.58s] with gorillas in Rwanda.
[814.58s - 816.94s] And gorillas are the, we have to go.
[816.94s - 818.74s] That sounds unreal.
[818.74s - 820.06s] It was unbelievable.
[820.06s - 822.58s] And they're the animal that's revered in Rwanda.
[822.58s - 825.06s] So whenever they have a new gorilla that's born,
[825.06s - 827.02s] they have a naming ceremony with the community.
[827.02s - 827.86s] I love that.
[827.86s - 828.70s] It's so beautiful.
[828.70s - 830.70s] But, and then I heard somewhere that you,
[830.70s - 832.46s] your first job was you were a dog walker.
[832.46s - 833.30s] Yeah.
[833.30s - 834.30s] And so I was thinking like,
[834.30s - 836.46s] do you have any lessons or anything you learned
[836.46s - 837.50s] by being a dog walker?
[837.50s - 839.22s] I think first jobs are so interesting.
[839.22s - 840.06s] Yeah.
[840.06s - 844.22s] No, I mean, I was always a super disciplined child.
[844.22s - 846.38s] Like meaning to my, like I just loved,
[846.38s - 849.34s] I would put myself to bed at seven PM,
[849.34s - 851.22s] be like, my mom would be like playing with me
[851.22s - 852.06s] and my little sister and be like,
[852.06s - 854.18s] mom it's seven, I gotta go to sleep.
[854.18s - 855.34s] Like it's time for my bedtime.
[855.34s - 856.90s] She'd be like, are you okay?
[856.90s - 859.14s] And so I was always that kid.
[859.14s - 862.06s] And so I think I just was always really eager to like work.
[862.06s - 864.82s] I don't know why I just like wanted to always have something
[864.82s - 866.74s] to do, something that I felt passionate about
[866.78s - 867.94s] that I really enjoyed.
[867.94s - 869.66s] And so yeah, when I was young,
[869.66s - 872.06s] I put some flyers around our community
[872.06s - 874.82s] and said I would walk dogs and I ended up getting people
[874.82s - 877.70s] that would get, let me have their dog for a few hours
[877.70s - 878.66s] and take it for a walk.
[878.66s - 882.10s] So I loved animals and I liked having something to do.
[882.10s - 885.34s] So I spent, I was a kid that liked to be by myself
[885.34s - 886.18s] with animals.
[886.18s - 889.34s] So like, I think that that was a cool,
[889.34s - 890.62s] very fitting thing for me.
[890.62s - 892.54s] Cause I got to be by myself walking,
[892.54s - 894.90s] but then also experience all these little dogs.
[894.90s - 895.74s] Yeah.
[895.78s - 896.62s] I wish I did that.
[896.62s - 898.18s] I used to deliver newspapers.
[898.18s - 899.42s] So that was my first job.
[899.42s - 902.18s] And it's not as glamorous in London because it's raining.
[902.18s - 904.50s] Was that what you were desiring or was it more just like?
[904.50s - 906.74s] No, I was just 14 years old and wanted to make some money.
[906.74s - 907.58s] Yeah, you were just like, I need a little cash.
[907.58s - 909.30s] I was like, I need to make some money.
[909.30s - 911.14s] And so I was like, oh, I'm going to start doing this.
[911.14s - 912.22s] And you don't get to, you know,
[912.22s - 914.90s] you'd see it in the movies where the paper boy
[914.90s - 916.30s] just like chucks the paper at the door,
[916.30s - 918.58s] but I'd have to actually go and put it inside.
[918.58s - 920.74s] So my only interaction with dogs is they were on the inside
[920.74s - 921.74s] grabbing the paper.
[921.74s - 922.58s] Oh, right, right.
[922.58s - 923.42s] And so yeah.
[923.42s - 924.26s] Like barking at you and stuff.
[925.26s - 927.82s] But I always love knowing about people's first jobs
[927.82s - 929.18s] and how things started for them
[929.18s - 931.34s] because of, you know, obviously where you are today.
[931.34s - 934.86s] But what do you think it was in those early years
[934.86s - 937.42s] where you just said you were very disciplined?
[937.42s - 940.22s] Like it sounds like you were aware of certain habits
[940.22s - 941.42s] that you built then.
[941.42s - 943.86s] What were some of the things that you feel confident about?
[943.86s - 947.46s] Or how did you look for validation in those early years?
[947.46s - 949.18s] And where did it come from for you?
[949.18s - 950.30s] I mean, it's interesting.
[950.30s - 951.74s] So Kylie, my little sister,
[951.74s - 953.90s] she was always the social butterfly.
[953.90s - 957.82s] I was always, I just liked being to myself.
[957.82s - 959.46s] I don't know if that's the Scorpio in me.
[959.46s - 961.94s] So it just came naturally or whatever.
[961.94s - 964.74s] I had a group of friends who I loved,
[964.74s - 968.06s] but I just, I like convividly remember just on the weekends
[968.06s - 970.02s] not running to go be with my friends all the time.
[970.02s - 971.26s] During the summer I was with them,
[971.26s - 973.70s] but on the weekends in between school,
[973.70s - 976.26s] I was really just by myself.
[976.26s - 978.50s] I would love to like hang out in my room.
[978.50s - 979.98s] I like was kind of a nerd.
[979.98s - 982.66s] I loved video games and like sitting on the computer
[982.66s - 983.74s] and playing Sims all day.
[983.74s - 986.02s] Like I just kind of liked being to myself.
[986.02s - 988.86s] And then all day long during the summer was with my horses.
[988.86s - 990.82s] And yeah, I don't know.
[990.82s - 992.58s] I just, it just brought me joy.
[992.58s - 995.10s] I don't think I have like a, you know,
[995.10s - 997.30s] a super long explanation for that.
[997.30s - 999.22s] It was so simple for me as a kid.
[999.22s - 1001.98s] Like it was just as simple as that made me happy.
[1001.98s - 1003.86s] And that's just what I wanted.
[1003.86s - 1007.94s] And it explains, I guess a lot of me now.
[1007.94s - 1009.78s] I went through like a phase where I felt
[1009.78s - 1011.26s] like I had to be around people.
[1011.26s - 1013.18s] I think I live a very social life
[1013.22s - 1015.30s] and my job is very social.
[1015.30s - 1018.62s] So I was, you know, kind of conditioned
[1018.62s - 1020.86s] to want to be around people a lot.
[1020.86s - 1023.74s] And then as, you know, the pandemic came around,
[1023.74s - 1025.78s] you're not around as many people anymore.
[1025.78s - 1028.22s] Now I'm just re-enjoying being by myself,
[1028.22s - 1029.74s] which is really cool.
[1029.74s - 1033.66s] And I had the best day on Sunday all by myself.
[1033.66s - 1036.06s] I got up, I went and rode my horses.
[1036.06s - 1040.34s] I like took my niece to ride her pony.
[1040.34s - 1042.18s] Just me and her, it was so nice.
[1042.18s - 1043.86s] Brought her back home, went to my house,
[1043.86s - 1045.82s] got in my cold plunge, went in my pool,
[1045.82s - 1047.58s] laid out journals.
[1047.58s - 1049.02s] Like I was having the best day
[1049.02s - 1050.62s] and I was just pretty much all by myself.
[1050.62s - 1052.34s] So I enjoy it so much.
[1052.34s - 1053.18s] I love that.
[1053.18s - 1054.70s] I'm sure that's so refreshing for people to hear too,
[1054.70s - 1056.58s] because I feel like people may
[1056.58s - 1058.10s] from the outside perceive a life
[1058.10s - 1059.42s] which obviously like you said for work,
[1059.42s - 1060.74s] it's busy and it's so cool.
[1060.74s - 1062.42s] And of course you have wonderful friends
[1062.42s - 1064.46s] but to know that you can feel comfortable
[1064.46s - 1066.66s] in your own company and that's been a habit
[1066.66s - 1067.50s] that you've developed all the time.
[1067.50s - 1068.98s] I crave simple things.
[1069.34s - 1072.82s] I love my life and I love my job.
[1072.82s - 1077.14s] And I feel so fortunate that I have been placed here
[1077.14s - 1079.34s] that for some reason I was given this life.
[1079.34s - 1082.70s] Like I feel immensely grateful for that
[1082.70s - 1084.46s] and I have had so much fun.
[1084.46s - 1087.50s] And I like think back on just the experiences
[1087.50s - 1088.54s] that I've had this far.
[1088.54s - 1091.02s] And it's shocking to me.
[1091.02s - 1094.22s] I'm like, this is so fricking cool that I live this life.
[1094.22s - 1096.14s] But at the end of the day, like when I am home
[1096.14s - 1098.42s] and when I'm alone, like I crave the simple things.
[1098.46s - 1099.78s] I love a simple day.
[1099.78s - 1101.82s] I love just like a simple routine
[1101.82s - 1104.94s] and being to myself and being around the people
[1104.94s - 1106.82s] that I love, my small core crew.
[1106.82s - 1108.42s] So yeah, that's beautiful.
[1108.42s - 1110.90s] Yeah, I mean, I think that's what we're all striving for
[1110.90s - 1113.34s] is that passion in our careers and our work
[1113.34s - 1115.38s] and then the simplicity at home.
[1115.38s - 1117.46s] What would you say, I was thinking about this
[1117.46s - 1119.22s] and I've watched so many of your interviews
[1119.22s - 1122.34s] and read so much too, but what would you say for you
[1122.34s - 1124.98s] as being one of your like proudest moments
[1124.98s - 1126.06s] or greatest achievements or something
[1126.06s - 1128.22s] that you really feel like and internally,
[1128.22s - 1130.42s] I mean, like for the basis of our conversation,
[1130.42s - 1133.34s] like something that really brings you joy internally
[1133.34s - 1135.94s] when you think about it or when you had it?
[1135.94s - 1138.50s] Like I said, I look back and the things
[1138.50s - 1141.46s] that I've accomplished, just even my job,
[1141.46s - 1145.38s] like I think I really at one point when I was younger
[1145.38s - 1148.06s] decided I want to be a model and this is what I want to do.
[1148.06s - 1149.94s] And the fact that I executed,
[1149.94s - 1151.50s] because we talk about that determination,
[1151.50s - 1154.94s] like I really was, I was 14 years old
[1154.94s - 1156.74s] when I kind of made that decision and was like,
[1156.74s - 1157.66s] this is what I want to do.
[1157.70s - 1160.46s] And I went to my mom and I was like, please help me do this.
[1160.46s - 1165.46s] And I didn't stop until I was 24 that I was like,
[1166.54s - 1168.82s] okay, I think I need to like take it back a notch,
[1168.82s - 1169.86s] which we can also get into
[1169.86s - 1172.22s] because that's a very kind of dramatic story.
[1172.22s - 1177.22s] But like I just knew and I think I'm proud of myself
[1177.58s - 1180.78s] for being that kid and being determined to do that
[1180.78s - 1183.30s] and then executing and doing it to the level
[1183.30s - 1186.50s] that I had done it and that I guess I still do.
[1186.54s - 1191.54s] But I also am proud of I think more so the self work
[1192.10s - 1194.14s] that I've done within that process
[1194.14s - 1196.94s] because there was a long period of time,
[1196.94s - 1199.58s] I'd say the core five years of it
[1199.58s - 1204.26s] that I was extremely overworked, not my happiest,
[1204.26s - 1206.42s] not because I wasn't doing what I loved,
[1206.42s - 1208.74s] but just because I was overwhelmed.
[1208.74s - 1211.82s] And I felt like I was saying yes to everything
[1211.82s - 1213.46s] because I felt really, really grateful
[1213.46s - 1216.02s] and really honored to be in the position that I was in.
[1216.06s - 1218.22s] So I was always saying yes.
[1218.22s - 1220.70s] And it just took a lot out of me to the point
[1220.70s - 1223.82s] where I just wasn't happy anymore.
[1223.82s - 1226.86s] And so I had to set those boundaries for myself
[1226.86s - 1228.38s] when I was about 23, 24,
[1228.38s - 1230.90s] I'd say like what a year before the pandemic.
[1230.90s - 1232.82s] So yeah, I was probably 23.
[1232.82s - 1234.50s] I really set boundaries for myself.
[1234.50s - 1236.26s] And I was like, I wanna continue to do this
[1236.26s - 1237.82s] because this is what I love.
[1237.82s - 1241.58s] But I need to start saying no when I can
[1241.58s - 1245.86s] and prioritizing me and prioritizing
[1246.82s - 1249.30s] my happiness and my wellbeing.
[1249.30s - 1251.30s] And it has done wonders for me.
[1251.30s - 1255.54s] Like I feel like I can show up better for myself
[1255.54s - 1257.74s] and I can show up a better person for the people
[1257.74s - 1259.74s] that get to be around me that day
[1259.74s - 1261.94s] and that I work with on that day.
[1261.94s - 1265.38s] So yeah, that's what I'm proud of.
[1265.38s - 1267.66s] Sorry to give you a long answer to your question.
[1267.66s - 1270.90s] That's an amazing, I won't say I was hoping for that
[1270.90s - 1273.46s] because I'm always open to wherever anyone's life
[1273.46s - 1274.82s] experience goes, but there's a part of me
[1274.82s - 1276.30s] that loves hearing that.
[1276.30s - 1277.58s] Like I really appreciate hearing that
[1277.58s - 1279.62s] because when you've achieved so many incredible things
[1279.62s - 1281.54s] in your career, what you have to then say,
[1281.54s - 1284.02s] well, this is the part like knowing how to navigate it
[1284.02s - 1286.86s] or making the right choices at the right time.
[1286.86s - 1287.90s] Healthy balance.
[1287.90s - 1288.74s] The healthy balance.
[1288.74s - 1289.70s] It's so important.
[1289.70s - 1291.50s] It's important for all of us.
[1291.50s - 1294.50s] Like we have to, this is what we're prioritizing.
[1294.50s - 1295.86s] You know, so.
[1295.86s - 1299.34s] How did you find the courage to do that at the 23 mark?
[1299.34s - 1302.22s] As you're saying, you're in a competitive industry.
[1302.22s - 1304.30s] As you said, it was overworking.
[1304.38s - 1305.86s] It's fast paced.
[1305.86s - 1307.90s] I'm guessing there's comparison in that industry.
[1307.90s - 1309.74s] There's competition in that industry.
[1309.74s - 1311.18s] It's not an easy space to be.
[1311.18s - 1315.58s] You're in the top 0.01% in your industry.
[1315.58s - 1317.34s] So it's hard.
[1317.34s - 1319.10s] And the reason I ask this is because I work with
[1319.10s - 1322.74s] so many people in this space and to have the courage to say,
[1322.74s - 1326.38s] no, I know that if I sort this out,
[1326.38s - 1328.78s] then all of this is gonna be just fine.
[1328.78s - 1331.74s] That actually takes more courage than we recognize.
[1331.74s - 1333.02s] We realize that when you have nothing,
[1333.02s - 1334.14s] then there's nothing to lose.
[1334.14s - 1335.78s] You can actually have a lot of courage.
[1335.78s - 1337.82s] But when you have everything and there's everything to lose,
[1337.82s - 1341.66s] and a lot of the time, at least what I've heard in town is,
[1341.66s - 1343.26s] you know, older managers and agents,
[1343.26s - 1344.54s] and I'm not saying you have any of this,
[1344.54s - 1345.90s] but people that I know will be told,
[1345.90s - 1347.58s] well, hey, if you don't do this,
[1347.58s - 1349.18s] like you'll be forgotten next year,
[1349.18s - 1350.82s] or you know, your career is only gonna last
[1350.82s - 1351.78s] another six months.
[1351.78s - 1353.86s] How did you have that courage to say, no, no, no,
[1353.86s - 1355.22s] I need to do this?
[1355.22s - 1356.46s] Like where did that come from?
[1356.46s - 1357.66s] I think that it's interesting,
[1357.66s - 1359.22s] like I've never thought about it that way
[1359.22s - 1360.66s] to be completely honest with you.
[1360.70s - 1364.62s] I just knew that if I had gone any further
[1364.62s - 1366.50s] that I was going to lose myself.
[1366.50s - 1371.50s] I was at that very, I was on the teeter-totter edge
[1371.50s - 1375.42s] of that point where had I gone any further,
[1375.42s - 1378.30s] I was probably not gonna be great.
[1378.30s - 1381.98s] It was so important to me to feel good
[1381.98s - 1385.22s] that I just knew that it was something that I had to do.
[1385.22s - 1388.90s] And I can't say, like, you're absolutely right.
[1389.78s - 1391.94s] There were so many people around me
[1391.94s - 1395.30s] that had told me not to say no,
[1395.30s - 1397.74s] and told me, yeah, told me not to say no,
[1397.74s - 1399.26s] told me not to stop.
[1399.26s - 1401.10s] I fought my way out of it a little bit
[1401.10s - 1403.34s] because there were people that had worked for me
[1403.34s - 1406.16s] that didn't want me to stop
[1406.16s - 1408.52s] because it might have benefited them.
[1408.52s - 1411.72s] But I got to that point and I just knew I had to do it.
[1411.72s - 1412.84s] And I just, I don't know.
[1412.84s - 1415.12s] I don't know how to explain it, I guess.
[1415.12s - 1418.24s] It was just such an unbelievable sensation that I had
[1418.88s - 1421.80s] I knew that if I do this, I'm gonna be better for everyone.
[1421.80s - 1423.32s] And I'm gonna be better for myself,
[1423.32s - 1425.68s] which means I'm gonna be better for the people around me
[1425.68s - 1426.68s] and I have to do this.
[1426.68s - 1431.68s] And so it wasn't really, I wanna be able to live
[1431.68s - 1435.56s] with happiness, God forbid any of this ever went away.
[1435.56s - 1438.20s] And I think that that was a big moment for me
[1438.20s - 1440.92s] of being like, I'm gonna be okay
[1440.92s - 1442.92s] if I don't get this job tomorrow.
[1442.92s - 1445.92s] And I'm gonna be okay if I don't get that job in a month.
[1445.92s - 1447.96s] If I have to take this time to do whatever,
[1447.96s - 1450.24s] things will come, everything's going to work out
[1450.24s - 1453.00s] the way it's supposed to and I had to trust that.
[1453.00s - 1454.52s] Well, to me from the outside,
[1454.52s - 1456.56s] and it's beautiful that you didn't see it in yourself
[1456.56s - 1458.84s] because that always makes it even more wonderful.
[1458.84s - 1460.16s] But the idea that to me from the outside,
[1460.16s - 1461.84s] that's a lot of courage.
[1461.84s - 1463.04s] It takes a lot of courage,
[1463.04s - 1465.60s] it takes a lot of vulnerability and openness
[1465.60s - 1467.36s] and it takes courage at every level,
[1467.36s - 1470.00s] whether someone's thinking about quitting their job
[1470.00s - 1471.52s] to do something they love
[1471.52s - 1474.00s] or whether someone's trying to relocate their family
[1474.00s - 1474.88s] and doesn't know how,
[1474.88s - 1477.24s] or whether someone like you is feeling success
[1477.24s - 1478.40s] and then going, well, wait a minute.
[1478.40s - 1479.60s] And I think in the past few years,
[1479.60s - 1482.92s] we've seen athletes and musicians and actors
[1482.92s - 1485.16s] and people in all creative industries step back
[1485.16s - 1487.32s] and say, well, I need to put me first.
[1487.32s - 1489.48s] And I think that that's empowering
[1489.48s - 1491.28s] because I think we hear about burnout
[1491.28s - 1494.60s] in work culture and corporate culture so often.
[1494.60s - 1495.44s] For sure.
[1495.44s - 1498.36s] So what was it that you started to do
[1498.36s - 1500.56s] at that newfound time at that time?
[1500.56s - 1503.60s] Like, is that where the curiosity was always there
[1503.60s - 1505.04s] and now you could actually follow it?
[1505.04s - 1507.64s] It was, it was always there.
[1507.64s - 1510.76s] And I had had a lot of people coming to me telling me
[1510.76s - 1514.16s] about meditation and how it changed their life
[1514.16s - 1517.04s] and therapy and so many different things.
[1517.04s - 1518.88s] And I was a bit overwhelmed
[1518.88s - 1519.72s] because I was like, oh my God,
[1519.72s - 1521.24s] what if this is gonna suit me?
[1521.24s - 1523.32s] I think it's a very personal experience.
[1523.32s - 1526.08s] I think everybody has a very different version
[1526.08s - 1527.28s] of all of that stuff.
[1527.28s - 1529.28s] And so it was a little overwhelming.
[1529.28s - 1530.76s] So I think I really just took the time
[1530.76s - 1532.24s] to be off for a second.
[1532.24s - 1533.52s] It was even the little things.
[1533.52s - 1536.40s] It was like being able to go to my friend's birthday party,
[1536.40s - 1538.52s] which I wouldn't have been able to go to before
[1538.52s - 1540.00s] because I was working a lot.
[1540.00s - 1541.64s] I love hearing that because I think
[1541.64s - 1544.04s] it is those simple things like,
[1544.04s - 1545.68s] giving yourself that space,
[1545.68s - 1548.00s] whatever it is that you needed to do,
[1548.00s - 1548.96s] when you needed it.
[1548.96s - 1550.96s] And like you said, sometimes it's like,
[1550.96s - 1552.64s] that's when all the subscribe buttons come up
[1552.64s - 1554.52s] in front of you and it's like, try this and try this.
[1554.52s - 1557.32s] And it's like, well, no, no, no, let me just take my time.
[1557.32s - 1559.64s] It was also now that I think about it.
[1559.64s - 1562.48s] 23, I'm 26, I've had my horse for,
[1562.48s - 1566.68s] so around that time is when I bought the horse
[1566.68s - 1569.72s] that I have now, who is my,
[1569.72s - 1572.12s] like I jumped her and I like have,
[1572.12s - 1574.32s] I have two other horses, but they're like retired.
[1574.32s - 1577.24s] So I don't really ride them the same way I ride her.
[1577.24s - 1579.28s] So yeah, I guess it was around that time too,
[1579.28s - 1581.72s] that I was like, I'm gonna do this cause I love this.
[1581.72s - 1583.28s] And like I want to get back into it.
[1583.28s - 1584.80s] And this is what I've loved my whole life.
[1584.80s - 1587.12s] So it was around that time that I feel like
[1587.12s - 1589.32s] all of that started happening and I bought my horse
[1589.32s - 1591.32s] and I like started taking more time
[1591.32s - 1593.64s] for things that made me really happy.
[1593.64s - 1595.64s] Yeah, what I'm noticing in you
[1595.64s - 1598.40s] and observing or at least from just these,
[1598.40s - 1601.28s] no, in a good way, in a good way, it's all good.
[1601.28s - 1602.84s] I was just saying, it feels like
[1602.84s - 1605.16s] no matter what's happening in your orbit,
[1605.16s - 1606.96s] there's this pillar of belief
[1606.96s - 1609.60s] that it's important to be happy.
[1609.60s - 1612.40s] That's like this core center belief in your life
[1612.40s - 1613.88s] where it's important to be happy,
[1613.88s - 1617.08s] it's important to be happy, that has to be the goal.
[1617.08s - 1622.08s] For sure, and it's not always easy.
[1622.16s - 1625.64s] We live in such an interesting industry
[1625.64s - 1629.20s] and in such an interesting time with social media
[1629.20s - 1632.60s] that it can be very hard sometimes.
[1632.60s - 1635.20s] You can fall victim to so many things
[1635.20s - 1639.35s] that don't serve you and that don't make you happy.
[1639.35s - 1644.35s] If your happiness depends on the actions of others,
[1644.87s - 1648.27s] you're at mercy of things that you can't control
[1648.27s - 1650.51s] and that's never where I wanna be.
[1650.51s - 1653.23s] So I always wanna live in like,
[1653.23s - 1655.67s] me and my therapist talk about like my higher goddess,
[1655.67s - 1658.91s] my higher self, like I always wanna live there
[1658.91s - 1661.86s] knowing that when I'm there,
[1661.86s - 1664.78s] you can't take that away from me, that's mine
[1664.78s - 1666.54s] and no matter what, you can disagree with me,
[1666.54s - 1669.54s] you can agree with me, that's not going,
[1669.54s - 1671.66s] I'm not changing, I'm not shifting, I'm here,
[1671.66s - 1672.90s] I'm in my higher goddess.
[1673.86s - 1677.96s] I kind of, I always live by like,
[1677.96s - 1681.12s] holding my happiness and not letting anyone else affect it
[1681.12s - 1683.56s] and though I fall victim to it at times,
[1683.56s - 1685.72s] as we all probably do,
[1685.72s - 1689.56s] I strive every day to live in that place.
[1689.56s - 1692.04s] What are some of the qualities of your higher goddess?
[1692.04s - 1694.64s] So that kind of avatar like-
[1694.64s - 1698.28s] She's awesome, like I said, I don't love a pity party.
[1698.28s - 1700.80s] I also like, sometimes it feels weird
[1700.80s - 1703.44s] to like say good things about yourself
[1703.44s - 1706.36s] but I've also learned a lot about talking to myself
[1706.36s - 1707.64s] and a lot about looking in the mirror
[1707.64s - 1710.24s] and being like, you're great, you're gorgeous,
[1710.24s - 1713.44s] you're amazing, you're loyal, you're positive,
[1713.44s - 1716.40s] you're so many, like I love words of affirmation,
[1716.40s - 1719.64s] I love just sitting there and reassuring myself
[1719.64s - 1723.64s] of who I am because that's another thing for me,
[1723.64s - 1726.88s] you know, there's so many false narratives
[1726.88s - 1729.00s] about me, about all of us, I'm sure,
[1729.00s - 1732.36s] like so many people think they have you figured out
[1732.36s - 1735.44s] when they don't even know the half of it.
[1735.44s - 1737.28s] So sitting there and being like,
[1737.28s - 1738.92s] you know, you get frustrated sometimes,
[1738.92s - 1740.28s] it could feel really unfair,
[1740.28s - 1741.36s] you could be reading something
[1741.36s - 1742.64s] that someone is saying about you
[1742.64s - 1744.56s] or hearing something that someone's saying about you
[1744.56s - 1746.32s] and being like, that is so unfair
[1746.32s - 1747.72s] because that's not who I am.
[1747.72s - 1750.20s] And that really gets to me sometimes
[1750.20s - 1752.00s] and that really sucks.
[1752.00s - 1753.40s] But then looking at myself in the mirror
[1753.40s - 1755.36s] and being like, but I know who I am
[1755.36s - 1758.16s] and that's all, why does anything else matter?
[1758.16s - 1759.52s] And my friends know who I am
[1759.52s - 1762.28s] and my family knows who I am, my dog knows who I am,
[1762.28s - 1763.40s] my horse knows who I am,
[1763.40s - 1766.76s] like why does any of everything else is just noise?
[1766.76s - 1769.40s] I do this exercise, I don't think I've shared this before
[1769.40s - 1771.68s] but I do this exercise with some of my clients
[1771.68s - 1772.72s] where we'll go on a walk
[1772.72s - 1774.92s] and we'll be on a hike wherever we are.
[1774.92s - 1779.08s] And I'll ask them what they think a piece of,
[1779.08s - 1780.56s] you know, maybe there's a little leaf
[1780.56s - 1782.56s] or maybe there's a flower
[1782.56s - 1785.20s] or something that looks a little unique on the path.
[1785.20s - 1787.84s] And I'll say, what do you think that feels like
[1787.84s - 1789.68s] and what do you think it would feel like
[1789.68s - 1791.60s] if you picked it up in your hand?
[1791.60s - 1793.32s] And they'll be like, oh, it looks really rough
[1793.32s - 1794.96s] and like it might scratch me
[1794.96s - 1796.92s] and like it looks like a bit, you know,
[1796.92s - 1798.56s] like uneven or whatever
[1798.56s - 1800.92s] and it looks kind of hard and strong.
[1800.92s - 1803.08s] And then I'll ask them to pick it up
[1803.08s - 1806.70s] and nine times out of 10, it's completely different.
[1806.70s - 1807.54s] Like they'll pick it up
[1807.54s - 1809.22s] and it will just dissolve in their hands
[1809.22s - 1812.14s] or they'll turn it over and the color's really soft.
[1812.14s - 1814.10s] Sorry, the shape, the shape's really soft
[1814.10s - 1816.54s] and the color's totally different on the other side.
[1816.54s - 1818.54s] And I do that exercise to help us realize
[1818.54s - 1820.98s] just how multifaceted humans are.
[1820.98s - 1822.06s] Today I've got to meet you
[1822.06s - 1823.90s] and obviously we're spending a lot of deep,
[1823.90s - 1825.42s] intimate, vulnerable time together.
[1825.42s - 1827.50s] So you learn faster about someone
[1827.50s - 1830.02s] but if someone only follows someone on social media
[1830.02s - 1831.74s] or only sees someone at an event
[1831.74s - 1833.74s] or only sees one interview,
[1833.74s - 1837.18s] it's so easy to create such a singular view of someone.
[1837.18s - 1839.30s] And I think, and I wanna say this
[1839.30s - 1841.14s] because I really think we all feel it,
[1841.14s - 1846.10s] I don't think anyone wants to be seen in a singular way.
[1846.10s - 1848.38s] If you had to choose one word
[1848.38s - 1850.50s] that had to be you for the rest of your life,
[1850.50s - 1851.86s] I don't think anyone wants that.
[1851.86s - 1854.30s] I think we all know that we're messy
[1854.30s - 1856.98s] and complex and different.
[1856.98s - 1859.66s] But we like to put someone else in a box,
[1859.66s - 1861.14s] whoever that may be,
[1861.14s - 1863.26s] because it's easier than to live life
[1863.26s - 1867.26s] and say, okay, well, that's persons A, B, you know.
[1867.26s - 1869.34s] So there's this beautiful piece of wisdom
[1869.34s - 1872.22s] that I always share from Charles Horton Cooley
[1872.22s - 1875.10s] and he wrote this in 1890, I think it was,
[1875.10s - 1877.42s] which just shows how true this has been
[1877.42s - 1878.38s] for such a long time
[1878.38s - 1880.54s] and obviously long before that as well.
[1880.54s - 1882.94s] And he said, the challenge today is,
[1882.94s - 1884.86s] I'm not what I think I am.
[1884.86s - 1886.94s] I'm not what you think I am.
[1886.94s - 1890.82s] I am what I think you think I am.
[1890.82s - 1892.54s] And we'll let that blow everyone's mind right?
[1892.54s - 1894.94s] It gives me chills every time I say it.
[1894.94s - 1896.50s] Charles Horton Cooley said,
[1896.50s - 1899.18s] the challenge today is I'm not what I think I am.
[1899.18s - 1901.62s] I'm not what you think I am.
[1901.66s - 1904.98s] I am what I think you think I am.
[1904.98s - 1906.82s] And what he's trying to say is that we live
[1906.82s - 1909.82s] in a perception of a perception of ourselves.
[1909.82s - 1912.82s] So if I think you think I'm smart,
[1912.82s - 1914.86s] then I allow myself to feel smart.
[1914.86s - 1915.70s] Right.
[1915.70s - 1916.66s] It's like we need that validation.
[1916.66s - 1917.98s] We need that validation.
[1917.98s - 1922.98s] Or if I think you think I'm not smart, then I feel hurt.
[1922.98s - 1924.18s] And the challenge is,
[1924.18s - 1925.74s] I don't know what you're thinking at all,
[1925.74s - 1927.26s] especially outside in the world.
[1927.26s - 1929.34s] And so I find that what you're saying around like,
[1929.34s - 1931.02s] well, what do I think about myself?
[1931.02s - 1932.10s] Like how do I feel about myself?
[1932.10s - 1934.98s] How do the people that actually know me feel about me?
[1934.98s - 1936.50s] I think that's really empowering.
[1936.50s - 1938.74s] I wanted to ask you because I feel like
[1938.74s - 1940.54s] from what I've seen and from what I've heard,
[1940.54s - 1941.82s] you have great friendships.
[1941.82s - 1943.10s] You have a great relationship with your families.
[1943.10s - 1945.30s] You said like, what do you think have been
[1945.30s - 1949.10s] really great habits or traits in relationships
[1949.10s - 1950.62s] that have helped you build up good friendships
[1950.62s - 1951.90s] and family relationships?
[1951.90s - 1953.78s] Because I think for so many people,
[1953.78s - 1955.66s] sometimes their friendships and their family
[1955.66s - 1957.94s] can often be the most difficult part.
[1957.94s - 1959.94s] But I feel like the way you communicate
[1959.94s - 1960.90s] or the way you're talking about it,
[1960.90s - 1963.34s] I'm like, okay, there's some really good habits in place here.
[1963.34s - 1965.06s] Have there been any principles or rules
[1965.06s - 1967.82s] that you've learned along the way that have been helpful?
[1967.82s - 1970.14s] I mean, of course honesty,
[1970.14s - 1974.42s] I'm a big person on like keeping a really honest,
[1974.42s - 1976.62s] healthy communicative relationship.
[1977.74s - 1979.50s] But I also think like,
[1979.50s - 1982.44s] I find it really important to have,
[1982.44s - 1984.26s] not feel like you're on top of each other
[1984.26s - 1986.70s] when you have your family around or your friends around.
[1986.70s - 1988.70s] It's okay to like sometimes,
[1988.70s - 1990.30s] even if you're at like a family dinner
[1990.30s - 1991.58s] or running to the bathroom and just being like,
[1991.58s - 1993.30s] let me just take a couple of breaths
[1993.30s - 1994.70s] because this is getting overwhelming.
[1994.70s - 1995.54s] That's a great one.
[1995.54s - 1996.38s] Do you know what I mean?
[1996.38s - 1999.02s] So I just love to like take a second.
[1999.02s - 2000.22s] My feelings are valid.
[2000.22s - 2001.94s] Like sometimes my family's a lot,
[2001.94s - 2003.86s] which I bet everyone already knows.
[2003.86s - 2007.26s] Everyone's family's are have a sense of crazy to them.
[2007.26s - 2011.22s] But I think that I can get really overwhelmed really easily.
[2011.22s - 2015.63s] I am prone to just a good amount of anxiety
[2015.63s - 2017.71s] and just being extremely overwhelmed
[2017.71s - 2020.43s] and kind of taking everything too seriously sometimes.
[2020.47s - 2022.07s] So I like to just step away sometimes
[2022.07s - 2023.59s] and just be like, this is okay.
[2023.59s - 2024.71s] I'm allowed to feel this way.
[2024.71s - 2025.55s] It's valid.
[2025.55s - 2026.59s] I'm just going to take a deep breath
[2026.59s - 2027.43s] and I'm not going to react.
[2027.43s - 2028.31s] And then I'm going to go back out there
[2028.31s - 2029.39s] and I'm going to be fine.
[2029.39s - 2031.63s] So sometimes I do that.
[2031.63s - 2032.47s] I love that.
[2032.47s - 2033.31s] I love how easy it is.
[2033.31s - 2036.71s] No one needs to learn a new meditation practice or new thing.
[2036.71s - 2038.87s] Sometimes it's just as simple as that.
[2038.87s - 2040.15s] Yeah, it's as simple as that.
[2040.15s - 2040.99s] I love that.
[2040.99s - 2043.83s] I, you know, one of the things that, you know,
[2043.83s - 2045.67s] which really touched my heart when I saw this
[2045.67s - 2048.47s] because I think when things happen in culture
[2048.47s - 2049.75s] and everyone talks about it,
[2049.95s - 2052.11s] but sometimes you're like, okay, well, I can tell that
[2052.11s - 2053.11s] there's a real connection here.
[2053.11s - 2055.31s] Like when you lost Virgil, right?
[2055.31s - 2057.55s] Like that, when I saw your message
[2057.55s - 2059.19s] and what you spoke about it, I was like, wow,
[2059.19s - 2061.31s] this is someone who had a really deep connection
[2061.31s - 2062.15s] with this individual.
[2062.15s - 2064.95s] And going through grief is really, really tough.
[2064.95s - 2066.07s] Like, you know, people who lose,
[2066.07s - 2068.63s] and I lost two really close people to me
[2068.63s - 2069.75s] during the pandemic.
[2069.75s - 2070.59s] I'm sorry.
[2070.59s - 2071.43s] One was, thank you.
[2071.43s - 2074.67s] One was my spiritual teacher since I was 12 years old
[2074.67s - 2077.19s] and he died of stage four brain cancer
[2077.31s - 2079.79s] and I hadn't seen him during the pandemic.
[2079.79s - 2080.95s] I couldn't go back for his,
[2080.95s - 2082.35s] because that was still when it was like,
[2082.35s - 2085.19s] I locked down so I couldn't go back for his funeral.
[2085.19s - 2087.15s] And, you know, he'd been the person
[2087.15s - 2089.95s] who'd been such a key piece of my life.
[2089.95s - 2092.71s] And then the other person pretty much in the same year
[2092.71s - 2095.43s] was my best friend as a monk.
[2095.43s - 2096.71s] So he was still a monk.
[2096.71s - 2097.55s] Wow.
[2097.55s - 2098.91s] And he happened to get cancer
[2098.91s - 2100.03s] and he passed away during the pandemic.
[2100.03s - 2100.99s] I couldn't see him either.
[2100.99s - 2102.03s] And he was my age.
[2102.03s - 2104.19s] And so to lose someone that was, you know,
[2104.19s - 2105.03s] and he was still there.
[2105.03s - 2106.39s] And so, yeah.
[2106.75s - 2108.59s] And so when I saw your, you know,
[2108.59s - 2111.39s] your wonderful tribute to Virgil as well,
[2111.39s - 2114.63s] I was like, you know, how do you process something like that
[2114.63s - 2117.27s] when, you know, it's not only industry friends,
[2117.27s - 2120.51s] but genuine friendship beyond that and just, yeah.
[2120.51s - 2122.15s] Well, my first thought here is,
[2122.15s - 2123.95s] why is it always the best people?
[2123.95s - 2125.79s] Like why is it always these people
[2125.79s - 2129.95s] that are just such balls of light in everyone's life?
[2129.95s - 2131.79s] It's like so, you just think about it
[2131.79s - 2133.15s] and you're like, this is so unfair
[2133.15s - 2135.15s] and you're going through every emotion.
[2135.27s - 2138.93s] And to be honest, it was really shocking
[2138.93s - 2143.09s] because not everyone knew what he was going through
[2143.09s - 2144.05s] and suffering from.
[2144.05s - 2146.93s] So it was really shocking.
[2146.93s - 2148.97s] I'll never forget the day I found out.
[2148.97s - 2153.85s] And it just absolutely obviously breaks your heart.
[2153.85s - 2158.82s] And you can't help but be like, oh my God,
[2158.82s - 2160.70s] did I ever say enough?
[2160.70s - 2162.86s] Did I ever tell him enough?
[2162.86s - 2165.38s] It's really interesting to share that feeling
[2165.42s - 2167.18s] with so many people.
[2167.18s - 2170.02s] It feels good in a way and you're just like,
[2170.02s - 2172.70s] it makes you feel so human.
[2172.70s - 2175.50s] And you're sharing this emotion with people that knew him,
[2175.50s - 2177.06s] people that didn't know him,
[2177.06s - 2179.46s] people that just loved him from afar.
[2179.46s - 2184.26s] And it's just a really beautiful and incredible thing
[2184.26s - 2185.26s] to a certain degree,
[2185.26s - 2189.26s] but then also just obviously the most devastating thing.
[2189.26s - 2193.22s] It hits so hard when so many people are talking about it
[2193.22s - 2195.06s] and so many people are affected by it.
[2195.82s - 2199.74s] It was definitely a really shocking,
[2199.74s - 2201.70s] really sad time.
[2201.70s - 2203.10s] It was, yeah.
[2203.10s - 2205.22s] Yeah, and it's really interesting what you said there.
[2205.22s - 2207.98s] And I had that with my spiritual teacher for sure.
[2207.98s - 2211.51s] I was just like, oh, like he was, you know,
[2211.51s - 2215.47s] and what's really powerful about what I could at least
[2215.47s - 2217.75s] remember from him at that time was that
[2217.75s - 2219.23s] even though he had stage four brain cancer,
[2219.23s - 2222.23s] which means he'd lost his short-term memory
[2222.23s - 2224.35s] and a lot of his long-term memory is impaired,
[2224.39s - 2226.15s] if you ever met him,
[2226.15s - 2228.43s] he would just thank you for your service to God.
[2228.43s - 2229.67s] Like he would just say thank you
[2229.67s - 2231.43s] for everything you're doing for other people
[2231.43s - 2233.27s] and he would just be grateful.
[2233.27s - 2234.11s] And I was just like, how?
[2234.11s - 2236.15s] That's exactly how V was too.
[2236.15s - 2241.15s] He was the most positive, lived life,
[2241.15s - 2245.67s] like appreciative, wanted to say yes to everything,
[2245.67s - 2248.43s] wanted to just be there for everyone.
[2248.43s - 2251.51s] You could literally ask him to design a pencil for you
[2251.51s - 2253.55s] and he would be like, it'll be done tomorrow.
[2253.95s - 2254.79s] What else do you need?
[2254.79s - 2259.79s] Like he just had so much to give and he gave it
[2259.83s - 2263.47s] and that was pre his diagnosis.
[2263.47s - 2266.19s] That was just who Virgil was.
[2266.19s - 2269.55s] And so to then find out what he found out
[2269.55s - 2272.03s] at a certain point in his life and still be that person,
[2272.03s - 2273.95s] it's to like, I'm gonna show up for everyone.
[2273.95s - 2277.31s] And like my time here is so special
[2277.31s - 2280.79s] to all these other people and I'm going to be here
[2280.79s - 2282.51s] to make them feel amazing.
[2282.55s - 2284.23s] It's just like unreal.
[2284.23s - 2286.79s] Like it makes you just be like, what?
[2286.79s - 2290.63s] Like how could you be that incredible and giving?
[2290.63s - 2292.59s] Like that is so crazy.
[2292.59s - 2294.71s] There wasn't a selfish bone in that man's body.
[2294.71s - 2296.83s] Like he was just the best.
[2296.83s - 2298.55s] But I'm sorry to hear about your.
[2298.55s - 2301.59s] Oh no, no, I think it's actually nice speaking
[2301.59s - 2304.75s] about people that we both love in a similar way,
[2304.75s - 2306.95s] even though they're in such different places in life
[2306.95s - 2308.63s] doing very different things.
[2308.63s - 2310.23s] But to talk about someone's,
[2310.23s - 2311.87s] and I think that's a big part of it for me,
[2311.91s - 2313.63s] at least with grief that I feel like
[2313.63s - 2315.99s] when I talk about the beautiful qualities
[2315.99s - 2317.91s] of the people that I lost,
[2317.91s - 2320.59s] it gives me so much confidence
[2320.59s - 2323.52s] that they want me to live it.
[2323.52s - 2325.20s] And they want me to try and embody it
[2325.20s - 2327.28s] and that how fortunate we are
[2327.28s - 2329.24s] to have experienced that type of humanity.
[2329.24s - 2331.84s] Yeah, and those are my thoughts of him.
[2331.84s - 2334.76s] Like I think all we ever really want as human beings
[2334.76s - 2337.32s] is to be, when we do leave this earth,
[2337.32s - 2339.84s] we want to be remembered so beautifully
[2339.84s - 2343.08s] and positively, I know at least I do of course,
[2343.08s - 2344.80s] but like you just want,
[2344.80s - 2347.72s] you of course want to make people feel something.
[2347.72s - 2350.04s] And he made so many people feel something.
[2350.04s - 2352.12s] And for that, it is so special.
[2352.12s - 2355.12s] Like what do they say that we have our purpose here
[2355.12s - 2357.96s] and I know that he fulfilled a purpose here
[2357.96s - 2359.28s] that he was supposed to fulfill.
[2359.28s - 2362.92s] And I think that that's, I think about it beautifully.
[2362.92s - 2366.48s] Like I obviously it's a very, very sad situation
[2366.48s - 2369.04s] and it breaks my heart.
[2369.04s - 2372.08s] But I have nothing but beautiful thoughts of him.
[2372.08s - 2374.52s] And I think that's really cool and really special.
[2374.52s - 2376.32s] Yeah, thank you for sharing that too.
[2376.32s - 2379.92s] And I had to ask you because yeah, I just,
[2379.92s - 2383.04s] I love hearing amazing things about amazing people that,
[2383.04s - 2385.12s] because I think so many of the most incredible people,
[2385.12s - 2388.08s] I grew up reading about people that I never met.
[2388.08s - 2390.84s] And I spent a lot of my life studying books about people
[2390.84s - 2391.68s] that I never met.
[2391.68s - 2394.28s] So Malcolm X and Martin Luther King and Einstein
[2394.28s - 2396.56s] and people that I really see as people
[2396.56s - 2399.00s] that have directed so much of my life.
[2399.04s - 2400.84s] From how they lived.
[2400.84s - 2403.76s] And I feel like he was potentially one of those people
[2403.76s - 2405.80s] that I never met him, but whenever I hear about him,
[2405.80s - 2408.24s] I'm just like, oh, this is someone that we could learn
[2408.24s - 2411.20s] from you, you spoke about purpose there.
[2411.20s - 2412.96s] I was wondering how is your purpose changed?
[2412.96s - 2416.52s] You had this very confident view of I wanna be a model,
[2416.52s - 2418.88s] you know, you've superseded, exceeded
[2418.88s - 2421.20s] and continue to flourish in that world.
[2421.20s - 2423.48s] And I always wish that you do.
[2423.48s - 2426.76s] How has your purpose evolved as that time's gone on?
[2426.76s - 2427.88s] I think I've learned a lot.
[2427.88s - 2430.20s] I've learned a lot about myself,
[2430.20s - 2432.12s] about what I want from my life
[2432.12s - 2434.20s] and which is kind of what we've been talking about.
[2434.20s - 2438.64s] But I'm actually really excited to get older
[2438.64s - 2442.04s] and to learn so much more about not only myself,
[2442.04s - 2444.80s] but like the journey and the path
[2444.80s - 2447.92s] that I guess want to take and want to be on.
[2447.92s - 2451.52s] So I'd say, you know, my purpose has evolved
[2451.52s - 2455.96s] from obviously within business doing what I wanna do
[2455.96s - 2458.80s] and making sure I'm happy and finding the thing
[2458.80s - 2460.92s] that I love and all those things.
[2460.92s - 2464.52s] But I've kind of like I said, really tuned into me.
[2464.52s - 2467.20s] And I think my purpose, at least at this very moment
[2467.20s - 2471.20s] and what I've kind of evolved into is my higher goddess.
[2471.20s - 2474.84s] Like I am determined to tune into her at all times.
[2474.84s - 2478.83s] But also as I get older, I have so much
[2478.83s - 2483.44s] that I want to connect with other people
[2483.44s - 2486.60s] and with, you know, AKA social media
[2486.60s - 2489.16s] and people that may not know me personally
[2489.16s - 2490.80s] and just, you know, the following.
[2490.80s - 2494.20s] Like I said, I was given this life for some reason,
[2494.20s - 2496.28s] for whatever reason I was placed here.
[2496.28s - 2501.20s] And I do feel a purpose to share and connect
[2501.20s - 2503.92s] and put a smile on people's faces
[2503.92s - 2505.96s] or make someone feel a positive feeling.
[2505.96s - 2509.60s] And so I think that within me wanting to achieve
[2509.60s - 2511.22s] me tuning into my higher goddess,
[2511.22s - 2515.26s] I think that also entails me being a great version
[2515.26s - 2519.48s] of myself for other people to then experience
[2519.48s - 2522.60s] and my tips and my tools and whatever I can share,
[2522.60s - 2526.36s] whatever help I can give, I really, you know,
[2526.36s - 2528.76s] as corny as it sounds, I wanna spread love.
[2528.76s - 2530.80s] Like I want people to feel love.
[2530.80s - 2533.32s] That's really, I guess, the purpose.
[2533.32s - 2534.88s] Yeah, that's beautiful.
[2534.88s - 2536.44s] I mean, what more could you ask for, yeah.
[2536.44s - 2537.28s] Right.
[2537.28s - 2539.28s] Yeah, and it is funny that so much of the stuff
[2539.28s - 2541.08s] that is corny or, you know, whatever,
[2541.08s - 2542.24s] that's the stuff that's true.
[2542.24s - 2543.08s] Right.
[2543.08s - 2543.90s] Like that's the stuff.
[2543.90s - 2544.74s] It is.
[2544.74s - 2545.58s] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2545.58s - 2546.42s] There's also just,
[2546.42s - 2548.08s] We all just like live in such a,
[2548.08s - 2550.04s] it's an interesting time, obviously,
[2550.04s - 2552.60s] and it can feel really negative.
[2552.60s - 2556.12s] And I tend to stay off of platforms
[2556.12s - 2557.68s] like social media platforms
[2557.68s - 2559.76s] because it's hard to look at sometimes
[2559.76s - 2560.86s] and it feels really negative.
[2560.86s - 2562.44s] So I feel like we all just need a little bit
[2562.44s - 2564.08s] of a smile sometimes.
[2564.08s - 2564.92s] Yeah, I agree.
[2564.92s - 2565.76s] I agree.
[2565.76s - 2568.28s] I post these videos every day,
[2568.28s - 2571.08s] which are just these fun, silly things
[2571.08s - 2571.92s] that happen in the world
[2571.92s - 2574.00s] that my team will find, I'll find.
[2574.00s - 2575.40s] And I post them every day, literally,
[2575.40s - 2576.80s] for that reason and that reason only,
[2576.80s - 2580.28s] because I'm like, I may or may not say something
[2580.28s - 2581.24s] that makes someone smile.
[2581.24s - 2582.08s] Right.
[2582.08s - 2582.92s] But this definitely will.
[2582.92s - 2583.76s] Yeah, right.
[2583.76s - 2585.08s] Like this without a doubt
[2585.08s - 2585.92s] will bring some joy to someone's life.
[2585.92s - 2586.76s] I love that.
[2586.76s - 2588.88s] And if this is the only joy that someone experienced,
[2588.88s - 2590.48s] I want them to see good in the world
[2590.48s - 2591.56s] and believe that there's good in the world.
[2591.56s - 2594.64s] That's one of my favorite things to see on TikTok
[2594.64s - 2596.84s] when I sit in my bed at night and fall victim to TikTok.
[2596.84s - 2600.68s] I love to see, there's people that I'll post like,
[2600.68s - 2603.60s] here's like five amazing facts that have happened
[2603.60s - 2605.56s] in the world in the last couple of weeks or whatever.
[2605.56s - 2607.84s] And it'll be like, the, you know,
[2607.84s - 2609.56s] pandas are not extinct anymore.
[2609.56s - 2612.16s] And like the Great Barrier Reef is coming back
[2612.16s - 2613.00s] and stuff like that.
[2613.00s - 2614.32s] And so I'm like, that's so cool.
[2614.32s - 2615.56s] That's what I want to hear.
[2615.56s - 2616.40s] Exactly.
[2616.40s - 2618.72s] And you know, if it was like, it's going down,
[2618.72s - 2620.60s] it's like, it's going to get a lot of likes and hits,
[2620.60s - 2623.80s] but if it's going up, it doesn't get the same attention.
[2623.80s - 2626.68s] Why do we like gravitate towards the negative so much?
[2627.52s - 2628.36s] Very interesting.
[2628.36s - 2629.20s] We have to retrain.
[2629.20s - 2632.08s] I genuinely believe it's just a pattern.
[2632.08s - 2635.16s] It's a pattern and a habit that's been adopted for so long.
[2635.16s - 2636.00s] Absolutely.
[2636.00s - 2637.56s] And we have to retrain ourselves.
[2637.56s - 2639.96s] The clickbait of it all and the whole thing.
[2639.96s - 2642.68s] And we're like, that's going downhill.
[2642.68s - 2644.04s] I need to see what's happening.
[2644.04s - 2647.04s] And we're just like, we do need to retrain our brains.
[2647.04s - 2648.40s] It's exactly what it is.
[2648.40s - 2650.08s] Yeah. And it starts with what you said earlier.
[2650.08s - 2652.08s] It starts with how we see ourselves.
[2652.08s - 2653.16s] It is all from that.
[2653.16s - 2655.92s] If someone looks in the mirror, as you were saying earlier,
[2655.92s - 2658.16s] or if someone just reflects on themselves,
[2658.16s - 2660.92s] not physically, but just internally,
[2662.12s - 2665.56s] most of us will spot all the negative things about ourselves.
[2665.56s - 2667.12s] And then we take that out into the world
[2667.12s - 2669.44s] and spot all the negative things about everyone else.
[2669.44s - 2672.24s] And then we take that out into social media.
[2672.24s - 2674.56s] So that just propels from, if you ask-
[2674.56s - 2675.40s] It's all a reflection of-
[2675.40s - 2677.60s] It's all, yeah, if we ask someone to sit down
[2677.60s - 2679.00s] and write down, as you said,
[2679.00s - 2680.84s] we feel uncomfortable taking a compliment
[2680.84s - 2682.40s] or we feel uncomfortable saying-
[2682.40s - 2683.80s] Saying nice about ourselves, right?
[2683.80s - 2684.64s] Exactly.
[2685.08s - 2687.04s] It all starts with our relationship with ourselves.
[2687.04s - 2691.16s] If we were able to find three good things about ourselves today,
[2691.16s - 2692.80s] I promise you, you're going to find three good things
[2692.80s - 2694.36s] about the person sitting in front of you.
[2694.36s - 2695.24s] And that will explain-
[2695.24s - 2696.76s] Right, exactly.
[2696.76s - 2701.76s] I do a lot of inner child work with my therapist.
[2701.76s - 2704.08s] And there's actually a trend on TikTok
[2704.08s - 2706.52s] that was going around, but coincidentally enough,
[2706.52s - 2709.32s] we ended up naturally speaking about it in my session.
[2709.32s - 2711.28s] And it was this trend on TikTok, I guess,
[2711.32s - 2714.56s] that was like a girl being like,
[2714.56s - 2717.24s] anytime you're being mean to yourself,
[2717.24s - 2719.04s] just think, this is who you're talking about.
[2719.04s - 2721.56s] And then it flashes to a photo of her as a kid.
[2721.56s - 2725.40s] And so me and my therapist were talking about something similar.
[2725.40s - 2727.84s] And she was like, why don't you find a photo of yourself
[2727.84s - 2730.04s] and put it on your bathroom mirror
[2730.04s - 2732.12s] so that every morning, every night,
[2732.12s - 2733.88s] every day when you walk into your bathroom mirror,
[2733.88s - 2735.44s] you're looking at her and you're remembering
[2735.44s - 2736.88s] that if there's anything negative
[2736.88s - 2738.08s] that you're ever saying about yourself,
[2738.08s - 2739.56s] if you're ever being mean to yourself,
[2739.56s - 2740.72s] you're talking about her.
[2741.00s - 2744.00s] And so I did that and I went into my,
[2744.00s - 2746.60s] I went into like my memorabilia closet in my house
[2746.60s - 2748.44s] and I was looking through old like photo books
[2748.44s - 2750.24s] and I've seen these photo books my whole life.
[2750.24s - 2752.72s] I've literally seen every photo that's been in here
[2752.72s - 2755.16s] and I like flipped to a page and there was a photo
[2755.16s - 2757.12s] I'd never seen of myself, ever.
[2757.12s - 2760.12s] It was a Polaroid, so it was the original photo
[2760.12s - 2762.24s] and it was just me as a little girl
[2762.24s - 2763.92s] with a bow and my hair out and a dress on
[2763.92s - 2765.40s] and I have like a little alien tattoo
[2765.40s - 2766.80s] or something right here.
[2766.80s - 2769.40s] And I'm like, have this big, cheesy smile on my face.
[2769.44s - 2771.52s] And I was like, that's the photo I'm putting on my thing.
[2771.52s - 2772.72s] I can show you the photo later.
[2772.72s - 2774.04s] I have a picture of it on my phone.
[2774.04s - 2777.88s] But so I pasted it on my bathroom mirror
[2777.88s - 2779.96s] and I talked to her and I'm always like,
[2779.96s - 2781.16s] if I'm ever looking in the mirror
[2781.16s - 2783.36s] and being negative towards myself or anything,
[2783.36s - 2786.28s] I always look right over to her and I'm like, she's dope.
[2786.28s - 2787.24s] And I love her.
[2787.24s - 2790.08s] And so it's just another way of just self love.
[2790.08s - 2790.92s] I love that.
[2790.92s - 2791.76s] That's such a great tool.
[2791.76s - 2792.60s] That's such a great tool.
[2792.60s - 2794.20s] My team found a kid picture of me
[2794.20s - 2795.92s] and made an embarrassing version of that trend.
[2795.92s - 2797.48s] So I'll show you that too.
[2797.48s - 2798.32s] Oh, awesome.
[2798.32s - 2799.16s] Okay, so you know it.
[2799.92s - 2802.28s] I know exactly what you're talking about as well.
[2802.28s - 2803.24s] Kendall, you were saying earlier
[2803.24s - 2805.12s] that you wanted to come here
[2805.12s - 2807.16s] and you wanted to share and you manifested it
[2807.16s - 2808.28s] and there were things you wanted to share.
[2808.28s - 2809.48s] What is it that's on your heart
[2809.48s - 2811.48s] that you've wanted to share
[2811.48s - 2813.16s] that maybe we didn't go there today already
[2813.16s - 2814.52s] or is there something on your mind and heart
[2814.52s - 2818.84s] as an experience or anything that really drew you here
[2818.84s - 2820.44s] and made this happen, right?
[2820.44s - 2822.91s] Like, I wanna honor that.
[2822.91s - 2824.15s] I think we've obviously,
[2824.15s - 2826.35s] we've honestly touched a lot of what I felt
[2826.35s - 2828.79s] like I would have loved to get off my heart.
[2828.79s - 2832.95s] I don't know, I was really excited honestly to come here
[2832.95s - 2836.55s] and share a little bit of me
[2836.55s - 2840.63s] that I feel is very sometimes scary for me to share.
[2840.63s - 2843.39s] And like I said, I came in here and I was a little nervous
[2843.39s - 2844.71s] because this is important to me.
[2844.71s - 2848.87s] And like this part of, you know, everyone's journey
[2848.87s - 2852.43s] and what we're talking about today is, it's so important.
[2852.43s - 2854.71s] I really, that was, I guess my intention here today
[2854.71s - 2857.07s] was to come in and share a little bit of me
[2857.11s - 2859.87s] and maybe for whoever's watching,
[2859.87s - 2862.51s] they find some comfort in this or some joy from this
[2862.51s - 2865.39s] or they understand me a little bit more,
[2865.39s - 2866.23s] you know what I mean?
[2866.23s - 2869.71s] So I think that we've hit a lot of really cool points
[2869.71s - 2872.63s] and yeah, I mean, I feel really good.
[2872.63s - 2873.83s] Good, I wanted to honor that.
[2873.83s - 2876.63s] I asked that because, you know, I think,
[2876.63s - 2879.35s] I think when you feel you're in that flow with someone
[2879.35s - 2881.23s] and yeah, I feel like, you know,
[2881.23s - 2882.87s] we've learned so many new things about you today
[2882.87s - 2884.75s] and there's so many moments where I'm like,
[2884.75s - 2886.91s] I just feel like you're so comfortable
[2886.95s - 2888.39s] and you've been so open with us,
[2888.39s - 2889.63s] but I just wanted to honor that.
[2889.63s - 2890.47s] Thank you.
[2890.47s - 2892.31s] And make sure that you feel that you've really felt heard
[2892.31s - 2893.15s] and seen.
[2893.15s - 2893.99s] I appreciate that.
[2893.99s - 2894.83s] Thank you.
[2894.83s - 2895.67s] So I want to be my friend.
[2895.67s - 2896.51s] I hope so.
[2896.51s - 2899.07s] We all want to just be understood at the end of the day, so.
[2899.07s - 2903.99s] I think the closer you get to people, humans,
[2903.99s - 2906.19s] the closer you get to people of different backgrounds
[2906.19s - 2908.80s] and different walks of life,
[2908.80s - 2911.52s] the more you start to recognize how similar we all are.
[2911.52s - 2912.64s] Yeah, exactly.
[2912.64s - 2915.24s] And how many challenges we all share,
[2915.24s - 2917.60s] despite how much money someone has in the bank,
[2917.60s - 2918.92s] despite how much fame someone has,
[2918.92s - 2921.12s] despite how much followers someone has.
[2921.12s - 2923.92s] And what we find is that everyone feels their own guilt
[2923.92s - 2926.40s] for where they are and everyone feels their own pressure
[2926.40s - 2928.76s] for where they are and everyone feels their own challenge
[2928.76s - 2930.16s] for where they are and you just start to realize
[2930.16s - 2935.16s] that we all have the same emotions in different mixes.
[2935.20s - 2937.04s] Yeah, we're all just having a human experience.
[2937.04s - 2937.88s] Exactly.
[2937.88s - 2940.32s] We're all just going day by day.
[2940.32s - 2942.76s] I think we all need to be a little bit kinder to each other
[2942.80s - 2946.12s] and just take it easy on some people,
[2946.12s - 2947.28s] because we are.
[2947.28s - 2949.08s] We're all, we all have our own struggles
[2949.08s - 2951.44s] and I don't know.
[2951.44s - 2954.60s] I'm an empath, so I feel for things
[2954.60s - 2958.36s] and I feel for people and yeah.
[2958.36s - 2960.68s] Yeah, and it starts with you, the person.
[2960.68s - 2962.04s] Right, exactly.
[2962.04s - 2962.88s] I thought you meant me.
[2962.88s - 2965.36s] I was like, I don't know, I don't have that power.
[2965.36s - 2966.20s] I was like, thank you.
[2966.20s - 2968.48s] No, no, no, I meant that to our listener.
[2968.48s - 2969.44s] Like it starts with yourself.
[2969.44s - 2970.28s] It starts with yourself.
[2970.28s - 2971.12s] Yeah, absolutely.
[2971.20s - 2972.76s] If you can be kinder to yourself,
[2972.76s - 2974.76s] chances are you're going to be,
[2974.76s - 2977.56s] I found that the days I stopped judging myself,
[2977.56s - 2978.64s] I stopped judging others
[2978.64s - 2982.00s] because it changed how I saw humanities.
[2983.00s - 2985.20s] Kendall, we end every On Purpose episode
[2985.20s - 2988.44s] with a final five, which is a fast five round.
[2988.44s - 2991.12s] I ask you a question and you answer it
[2991.12s - 2993.32s] with one word or one sentence maximum.
[2993.32s - 2994.88s] So it's super quick and sure.
[2994.88s - 2996.28s] And we have to whisk you away
[2996.28s - 2998.96s] because you need to go to your next appointment.
[2999.00s - 3001.16s] But okay, so the first question is,
[3001.16s - 3003.80s] what's something you're curious about right now?
[3003.80s - 3008.86s] Ooh, I am super curious about,
[3010.02s - 3013.18s] I was saying how I love Michael Singer
[3013.18s - 3014.38s] and I think what I really love,
[3014.38s - 3016.50s] I'm reading their Surrender experiment right now
[3016.50s - 3018.10s] and I'm only in the first couple chapters.
[3018.10s - 3019.94s] So he's basically, this is not a quick answer.
[3019.94s - 3021.74s] It's great, I love it though, please, please.
[3021.74s - 3024.34s] He's basically at the first part of the book
[3024.34s - 3027.90s] where he's talking about how he was curious about meditation
[3027.90s - 3029.34s] and how he got into meditation
[3029.34s - 3030.98s] and how he really just was on a trip
[3030.98s - 3032.98s] with his friends and his girlfriend in the woods
[3032.98s - 3035.14s] and sat in a corner or sat at a tree
[3035.14s - 3037.02s] and was like, I'm gonna just really dive into this
[3037.02s - 3038.18s] and see what happens.
[3038.18s - 3039.86s] That's what I'm curious about right now.
[3039.86s - 3042.10s] It's just actually, I meditate,
[3042.10s - 3044.66s] I do a lot of breathing work, breathing exercises
[3044.66s - 3048.18s] and I just really wanna tap in like Michael Singer did.
[3048.18s - 3051.42s] I love that, that's a great answer, that's a great answer.
[3051.42s - 3052.82s] Second question, if there's anything
[3052.82s - 3054.46s] that you're working on personally right now,
[3054.46s - 3055.82s] what are you working on on yourself?
[3055.82s - 3056.66s] Is there any?
[3057.62s - 3060.86s] I'm working on boundaries
[3060.86s - 3064.78s] and I'm working on not my stressor.
[3064.78s - 3068.26s] Like I can stress about things in my mind
[3068.26s - 3069.74s] and I overthink and I just,
[3069.74s - 3072.90s] so I'm really working on like calming down
[3072.90s - 3075.38s] and just letting things flow better
[3075.38s - 3077.78s] and not being so controlling over things,
[3077.78s - 3079.46s] especially that I can't control.
[3079.46s - 3080.38s] Love it.
[3080.38s - 3082.06s] Question number three,
[3082.06s - 3085.42s] what's your favorite thing about founding 818?
[3086.26s - 3088.02s] Being an entrepreneur and being a founder.
[3088.02s - 3092.22s] Probably that, like I was a model
[3092.22s - 3094.38s] and I worked for people a lot.
[3094.38s - 3096.22s] I kind of love being my own boss
[3096.22s - 3100.22s] and really being able to have my own creative,
[3100.22s - 3102.70s] a place where I can be creative
[3102.70s - 3104.90s] and just really express my creativity
[3104.90s - 3107.54s] and have so much fun doing all of that creative stuff
[3107.54s - 3110.62s] and I've learned so much and learning about the culture
[3110.62s - 3113.14s] and learning about the tequila and everything.
[3113.14s - 3115.22s] Like I've just had the best time, so.
[3115.98s - 3116.90s] Question number four,
[3116.90s - 3118.30s] what's something you used to value
[3118.30s - 3120.92s] but you don't value anymore?
[3120.92s - 3121.92s] Validation.
[3123.64s - 3124.48s] Great answer.
[3124.48s - 3125.92s] I don't care anymore.
[3125.92s - 3126.76s] Great answer.
[3126.76s - 3127.76s] At least I'm telling myself that.
[3127.76s - 3130.80s] Yes, yeah, well we have to make it a thought first.
[3130.80s - 3131.96s] No, but it's true.
[3131.96s - 3135.32s] Like I used to care so much more about validation.
[3135.32s - 3137.00s] I really don't care anymore.
[3137.00s - 3139.12s] At least as much, thank you.
[3139.12s - 3140.20s] Fifth and final question,
[3140.20s - 3142.04s] if you could create one law
[3142.04s - 3143.76s] that everyone in the world had to follow,
[3143.76s - 3144.96s] what would it be?
[3145.80s - 3148.92s] I would do like on like a Sunday,
[3148.92s - 3150.28s] you have to take half the day
[3150.28s - 3152.04s] and like not look at your phone or something.
[3152.04s - 3153.36s] That's great, I love that.
[3153.36s - 3155.00s] That's a legit law, that's great.
[3155.00s - 3156.36s] Great, it would be kind of nice.
[3156.36s - 3159.16s] Or the full day, work being really crazy.
[3159.16s - 3160.44s] I love that idea.
[3160.44s - 3161.56s] I love that.
[3161.56s - 3163.44s] Kendall Jenner, everyone, this was amazing.
[3163.44s - 3166.20s] Kendall, this honestly,
[3166.20s - 3168.16s] and I'm excited to catch up afterwards too,
[3168.16s - 3170.60s] but there was just so much flow and synergy
[3170.60s - 3172.04s] in this whole thing happening
[3172.04s - 3174.92s] and I couldn't thank you more for doing this with me.
[3174.92s - 3176.72s] I hope you're here on on purpose.
[3176.72s - 3178.76s] And I hope that this is the first and many times
[3178.76s - 3181.00s] that we'll do this, but I hope it's the beginning
[3181.00s - 3183.24s] of a beautiful friendship and relationship.
[3183.24s - 3185.88s] And I wanna, everyone who's been listening
[3185.88s - 3186.88s] or watching back at home,
[3186.88s - 3188.60s] please let me and Kendall know,
[3188.60s - 3190.96s] Tagas letting us know what resonated with you,
[3190.96s - 3191.92s] what connected with you,
[3191.92s - 3194.36s] like what was it that you've got curious about
[3194.36s - 3196.00s] or what was something she said
[3196.00s - 3197.72s] that just shifted your perspective
[3197.72s - 3198.80s] or where you learned something new.
[3198.80s - 3199.88s] I'd love to hear it.
[3199.88s - 3201.36s] I know there were tons of moments for me
[3201.36s - 3204.52s] where I was listening going, this is amazing.
[3204.56s - 3205.40s] This is incredible.
[3205.40s - 3206.24s] This is awesome.
[3206.24s - 3208.24s] So any wisdom nuggets that stuck out to you,
