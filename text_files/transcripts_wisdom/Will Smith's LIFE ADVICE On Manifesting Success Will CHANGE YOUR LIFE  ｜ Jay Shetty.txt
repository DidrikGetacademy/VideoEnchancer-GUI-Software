[0.00s - 4.96s] If you have a difficulty with another human being,
[4.96s - 9.28s] there's some point of ignorance and some point of delusion
[9.28s - 11.12s] that are keeping you from being able.
[11.12s - 11.76s] On both sides.
[11.76s - 12.72s] On both sides.
[12.72s - 15.20s] The problem is you can only worry about yours.
[15.20s - 19.60s] And then once you clear yours and your vision gets clean
[19.60s - 26.64s] and purified and you approach a person from a purified space,
[26.64s - 28.80s] things get a whole lot easier.
[35.46s - 38.58s] Hey everyone, welcome back to On Purpose,
[38.58s - 40.90s] the number one health podcast in the world,
[40.90s - 43.14s] thanks to each and every single one of you
[43.14s - 47.30s] that come back every week to listen, learn and grow.
[47.30s - 51.22s] Now today is a very, very special episode of On Purpose.
[51.22s - 54.50s] Not only is it the first episode of season three,
[54.50s - 59.14s] not only am I sitting down with the one and only Will Smith,
[59.14s - 61.94s] but today we're going to dive in to the mind,
[61.94s - 65.54s] the heart and the soul of the man behind the movies
[65.54s - 69.38s] and the music and my dear, dear spiritual brother and friend.
[69.38s - 73.14s] So Will, without any further ado,
[73.14s - 75.14s] I just want to say I am grateful.
[75.78s - 76.66s] I'm humbled.
[76.66s - 79.86s] I'm so happy to have spent so many special moments
[79.86s - 81.22s] with you over the past year.
[81.22s - 82.42s] This sounds romantic now.
[82.42s - 84.66s] My wife's going to get worried again.
[86.18s - 87.54s] But I mean it.
[87.54s - 90.10s] She's like, you've been spending a lot of time with Will.
[90.10s - 92.66s] Yeah, she's never felt uncomfortable
[92.66s - 94.50s] about my relationship apart from Will.
[96.74s - 98.34s] The only time she's doubted me is like,
[98.34s - 99.46s] oh, another trip with Will.
[100.90s - 102.34s] That's why this time she came along.
[102.34s - 104.50s] We certainly have some pictures.
[105.86s - 109.46s] Waterfalls, glaciers.
[110.90s - 112.74s] We definitely didn't even take all the pictures.
[112.74s - 115.22s] No, but thank you man.
[116.34s - 117.46s] This is going to be special
[117.46s - 119.86s] and I'm just excited for us to serve together
[119.94s - 120.66s] in this way.
[120.66s - 122.58s] No, this is fantastic.
[123.14s - 129.22s] It's been a long time coming for us to sit down like this.
[131.54s - 136.18s] For the people listening, it's probably been a year.
[136.18s - 137.70s] We're running up on a year now, right?
[137.70s - 138.18s] Yeah.
[138.18s - 140.74s] So it's like 10 months or something like that.
[142.34s - 146.02s] That I've been studying with Jay.
[146.58s - 152.18s] I fell in love with the Bhagavad Gita.
[152.18s - 153.54s] Jay and I have been spending time.
[153.54s - 154.58s] We've been hanging.
[154.58s - 155.86s] We've been traveling together.
[156.42s - 163.62s] Jay has really been the catalyst for this next phase of my life.
[163.62s - 172.50s] We have committed to one another in a brotherhood of service and support.
[173.06s - 184.58s] And I guess we've been in the gym working out for the past eight months.
[184.58s - 193.01s] And this is really our first time doing anything that's public facing.
[193.01s - 199.01s] So I'm excited to talk about what we've been working on.
[199.01s - 203.65s] And Jay's been working with my family pretty much every day.
[203.65s - 212.93s] A new Smith starts to study with Jay and also our teacher, Radhanath Swami.
[212.93s - 220.53s] So it's been a beautiful year and I'm very excited to start talking to people about what
[220.53s - 225.33s] we've been studying and learning and doing together.
[225.33s - 226.13s] Absolutely, man.
[226.13s - 228.37s] And I also want to say too, I think it's rare
[228.37s - 233.22s] where you get to sit down with someone that you've got to know intimately and closely.
[233.86s - 237.06s] And also when you sit down and I've probably watched, I'm trying to think,
[237.06s - 240.10s] I think I've watched every interview you've ever done over the years.
[240.10s - 242.66s] Before I met you, when I met you, I was always talking to you.
[242.66s - 246.82s] I'm like, oh, I remember you said this five years ago or 10 years ago you were saying this.
[246.82s - 249.38s] And when I'm sitting down with you now, I'm thinking, you know, it's,
[249.38s - 253.94s] I remember the first time I properly met you was at Willow's birthday a few years back.
[254.58s - 257.14s] And everyone was wearing, it was Willowine.
[257.14s - 259.06s] So everyone was dressed in costumes and stuff.
[259.06s - 260.58s] So I didn't even know it was you.
[261.46s - 266.10s] And then you had, you had like the Zorro kind of mask over your eyes.
[266.10s - 267.22s] And so it was a big press.
[267.22s - 268.34s] I was like, oh, maybe that's Will.
[268.34s - 268.90s] Maybe that's not.
[268.90s - 269.38s] I didn't know.
[269.38s - 271.30s] And then you lifted your mask off.
[271.30s - 275.70s] And the thing I recognized you about from the moment I met you was just your ability.
[276.34s - 282.66s] You have this unique ability to just be really present and kind and
[283.62s - 285.86s] and deeply there with everyone you meet.
[286.66s - 292.26s] And I think that for, you know, having, having met you in public arenas,
[292.26s - 294.82s] whether it was the bad boys premiere, and then in our personal meetings,
[294.82s - 297.94s] as you were mentioning, you're just even better.
[298.90s - 302.18s] And I think that that's so hard to be when you're that good.
[303.62s - 304.98s] So, but I remember that.
[304.98s - 307.86s] And that was the hospitality Min Radhi felt with you, like that,
[307.86s - 311.86s] that ability to care for each person, walking in the family aspect,
[311.86s - 316.82s] making us feel welcomed and a part of it that I just think that that in today's world,
[316.82s - 320.18s] that human aspect is what we're all missing.
[320.18s - 332.82s] I think that's that is a part of my DNA, you know, part of it from difficult aspects of my
[332.82s - 338.82s] childhood, you know, I grew up with violence in my home, you know.
[338.82s - 347.54s] So I developed, you know, a really acute emotional sense, you know, out of defense,
[347.54s - 350.34s] you know, I just needed to make sure that my father was okay.
[350.34s - 352.58s] I needed to make sure things were going well.
[352.58s - 362.42s] And I just became really hypersensitive to emotional movement in a room as a defense mechanism.
[362.50s - 368.42s] And then as I, you know, grew and as I started to develop that, you know,
[368.42s - 374.34s] that heightened sense that started out as defense, as I settled down and, you know,
[374.34s - 384.59s] came into a deeper understanding of my power and my desires in the world,
[385.15s - 391.23s] it was easier to connect to people in a loving way.
[391.79s - 399.23s] It transferred easily from a defense mechanism to an ability to love and care for people.
[399.23s - 402.27s] That's amazing, though, that you were able to process it positively.
[402.27s - 402.59s] Yeah.
[402.59s - 405.07s] I feel like we're living at a time, we've talked about this before,
[405.07s - 410.27s] that our childhood experiences form our adult desires.
[410.27s - 410.91s] Absolutely.
[410.91s - 414.99s] And I feel like now people are starting to hear that in the conversation where they're like,
[414.99s - 417.63s] oh, yeah, because this happened with my parents.
[417.63s - 418.43s] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[418.43s - 423.71s] Now I feel like this, how do you think you were able to, because we've talked about this before,
[423.71s - 427.15s] when you've talked about different, your mother, your father, what you learned from them,
[427.15s - 432.43s] tell us a bit about what you learned and how you were able to process it positively and engage
[432.43s - 435.87s] with it rather than create a negative story from it.
[435.87s - 438.91s] Because a lot of people may see violence and react differently.
[438.91s - 439.47s] Yeah, yeah.
[439.47s - 448.19s] I think there's always an aspect of us that when we feel unloved, you know,
[448.19s - 454.67s] in any capacity, in any relationship, when we feel unloved, when we feel mistreated,
[455.23s - 463.55s] when we feel somehow disrespected, it's a natural reaction to want revenge.
[464.75s - 471.55s] And I think that's what happens with most people specifically in our most vulnerable stages when
[471.55s - 477.71s] we're children and we haven't done anything to deserve that kind of treatment.
[478.67s - 483.58s] It's really hard for the ego to not click into revenge, you know.
[484.14s - 496.72s] And once I discovered that mechanism, once I saw that most of us walk around with,
[497.36s - 502.48s] that, you know, we want revenge against that mistreatment.
[503.12s - 505.60s] It's a little piece of that with all of us.
[506.16s - 512.16s] So the problem is that when you seek revenge, you destroy yourself.
[512.88s - 524.50s] And that's the paradoxical conflict that we all live in.
[525.06s - 526.74s] Someone has mistreated us.
[527.90s - 529.26s] We want revenge.
[529.26s - 531.74s] But if we take it, we hurt ourselves more.
[533.18s - 534.30s] It's crazy how it's done.
[534.30s - 535.66s] Right, you know what I mean?
[535.66s - 541.90s] You know, so that is, as Radha Nath Swami referred to, the perplexing situation that we find ourselves in.
[542.62s - 549.97s] And the only answer is loving kindness.
[551.18s - 554.99s] And most of us don't want to hear that.
[555.07s - 557.71s] It's like, I'll take my chances with revenge.
[560.03s - 567.47s] I'm going to take my chances with punching this dude in the face or cussing this girl out or whatever it takes.
[567.47s - 570.51s] But I can't do loving kindness.
[570.99s - 578.75s] And for me, I had such a beautiful example of loving kindness in my grandmother when I was growing up.
[579.15s - 582.11s] I always knew I wanted to be that.
[582.67s - 584.99s] The way that she loved and cared for people.
[585.79s - 590.35s] I didn't realize that her giving was connected to her peace.
[590.99s - 595.95s] That was something that I got a concept of later.
[595.95s - 598.59s] But I always knew that that was my example.
[598.59s - 600.11s] And I think that's the critical part.
[600.11s - 601.55s] We need an example.
[601.55s - 603.87s] Somebody has to be an example.
[603.87s - 608.11s] Human beings are creatures of example.
[608.11s - 609.63s] We need, you got to see it.
[609.63s - 610.11s] Yeah.
[610.67s - 617.63s] So that's really where I am in my life right now.
[618.27s - 629.18s] I want to show what it looks like to be loving and kind and giving and forgiving.
[631.10s - 636.14s] And I just want to model those virtues as best I can.
[636.14s - 640.06s] It's amazing how the thing we think that's going to help us feel better.
[640.70s - 642.30s] Is actually what makes us feel worse.
[643.18s - 649.26s] And you hold on to it because somewhere inside of you, you feel you have to be the person to show that person.
[650.22s - 650.78s] The truth.
[650.78s - 653.34s] Like you feel like it's your responsibility.
[653.34s - 655.10s] You're going to be the hammer of justice.
[655.10s - 655.34s] Yeah.
[655.34s - 656.54s] And so you carry that.
[657.10s - 662.62s] And it reminds me of this thing, this lesson that we were talking about and sharing in our meetings was
[663.58s - 665.50s] this quote by Russell Barkley where he said,
[666.22s - 670.62s] people who need the most love, ask for it in the most unloving ways.
[670.62s - 671.34s] Absolutely.
[672.30s - 675.82s] And that's what you were saying when you were giving examples of people in our society today
[676.38s - 681.58s] who, it sounds crazy, but somehow they are seeking love.
[681.58s - 682.38s] Absolutely.
[682.38s - 690.46s] And when you kind of put that in your head, you're like, oh, that's just a plea, a begging.
[690.46s - 691.10s] A begging.
[692.06s - 695.02s] A literal like, it's not even a proposal.
[695.02s - 697.18s] It's like a demand for love.
[697.18s - 697.98s] Absolutely.
[697.98s - 698.62s] And you were saying that.
[698.62s - 699.66s] And I love what you said then.
[699.66s - 701.74s] That's why I'm bringing it back to what I was saying earlier.
[701.74s - 710.14s] The reason why I was highlighting the personal aspect of you is that I think that the example
[710.78s - 717.20s] that you're setting through who you can be is even more than what you've done.
[718.40s - 721.92s] What you've done is amazing and there's nothing to be taken away from it.
[721.92s - 724.88s] It's phenomenal what you're achieving and what you continue to achieve.
[725.44s - 730.88s] But being able to do that with a loving heart, that must be, I mean, how does that feel internally?
[730.88s - 732.16s] Does that also feel that way?
[732.16s - 738.00s] Or no, is that, are you like, no, no, Jay, the success feels way better than that, Jay.
[738.00s - 738.72s] You don't get it.
[738.72s - 746.24s] But no, but you know, we had that conversation and there was a real period in my life that I had to
[746.88s - 754.51s] struggle with, we can win or I can be nice, pick one.
[755.47s - 756.27s] Right.
[756.27s - 766.19s] And different people pick different things for the type of material world climbing,
[766.83s - 772.86s] you know, that I did for a big chunk of my life.
[775.79s - 781.98s] It was military minded, you know, we're going to get that flag to the top of that hill.
[783.28s - 787.36s] And you are going to help or you're not going to be here, right?
[787.36s - 789.12s] So that's that's one mindset.
[789.68s - 794.40s] And then after I got the flag to the hill a couple of times and kept getting the flag to the hill
[795.04s - 806.05s] and realized that you just, you don't feel good and you've scorched earth, you know, around you.
[806.05s - 810.53s] And you're like, nobody's really happy, you know.
[810.53s - 814.69s] And then I started to have to question that mindset.
[814.69s - 820.77s] You know, I had one of the greatest runs in Hollywood history, you know,
[821.33s - 827.81s] that eight number one movies all over a hundred domestic biggest global movie star,
[827.81s - 832.14s] all of that in my family was miserable, you know.
[832.70s - 839.17s] And I had equated winning with happiness, right?
[839.17s - 840.13s] It's like, we're winning.
[840.13s - 841.41s] What is your problem?
[841.41s - 851.01s] You know, you know, and the the transition from product focus,
[851.89s - 856.94s] like military minded, get to the top of that hill.
[856.94s - 860.54s] And then I shifted into a mindset.
[860.54s - 867.02s] And it was really my kids who brought me out of that shift into discovering,
[867.66s - 871.90s] like, well, damn, people really care about how they feel.
[874.54s - 883.10s] You know, as crazy as that sounds, you know, you know, my father wasn't concerned with how I felt.
[884.18s - 886.18s] You know, he wasn't concerned with how he felt.
[887.15s - 888.99s] He was military minded.
[888.99s - 890.19s] You achieved the mission.
[890.75s - 892.11s] And there's two possibilities.
[892.11s - 894.35s] When I give you a mission, there's two possibilities.
[894.35s - 897.63s] One, you complete the mission or two, you're dead.
[899.31s - 900.83s] You know, and that's what my father was saying.
[900.83s - 902.03s] I grew up with that. Oh, cool.
[902.03s - 907.39s] Right. I actually had to discover feelings.
[908.70s - 911.90s] Right. And start like, I used to have to really focus.
[912.70s - 914.06s] Okay. How's this person feel?
[914.06s - 915.18s] How's this person feel?
[915.18s - 920.54s] Not what do I need them to do and not they're wasting our time right now and we're losing time
[920.54s - 922.38s] and we're going to not finish this mission.
[923.02s - 932.45s] Right. But there's a there is a balance between the mindset of achieving and loving kindness
[933.09s - 938.19s] that at this point in my life, I've actually discovered the magical balance,
[938.19s - 946.67s] but it's really hard to get people to let go of the attack and defend achievement mindset
[947.23s - 957.31s] and trust the care and concern for your fellow humans as a way of creating higher production.
[957.31s - 961.23s] Yeah. Yeah. I hope everyone who's listening and watching right now is taking this in because
[962.03s - 968.11s] I think what you're painting is a very transparent, honest picture of our minds.
[968.11s - 968.75s] Yeah. Yeah.
[968.75s - 970.91s] Like I can relate to what you're saying.
[970.91s - 975.55s] So I can relate to times in my life where I've been so about winning
[976.27s - 979.79s] and success and numbers or whatever it may have been.
[980.35s - 985.31s] And and I know I'm not even becoming the person that I want to be in that process.
[985.31s - 989.95s] And I don't even like myself, but because you're choosing to like yourself because of what you're
[989.95s - 994.83s] achieving, you're finding a new way to like yourself, but not over who you really are.
[995.47s - 1000.75s] And so I just hope everyone who's listening and watching, you know, when you speak sometimes,
[1000.75s - 1006.59s] will it so it's so extreme because you've got so close to that emotion
[1006.59s - 1008.51s] that sometimes people can think, oh, no, that's a bit extreme.
[1008.51s - 1009.63s] I'm a bit more balanced.
[1009.63s - 1012.51s] But really, we all have that kind of doesn't make sense.
[1012.51s - 1017.23s] Like we all have a bit of that extreme instinct inside of us in some area of our life.
[1017.23s - 1018.11s] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1018.11s - 1021.23s] And it's it's sometimes a delusion to feel, oh, I'm actually balanced.
[1021.23s - 1024.19s] Like we sometimes listen and go, oh, yeah, no, that's him.
[1024.19s - 1025.87s] That's him. His father was military.
[1025.87s - 1030.19s] Yeah. Yeah. But I'm I'm I'm balanced, you know, and we always feel we always feel
[1030.67s - 1031.63s] we're balanced.
[1031.63s - 1033.47s] Exactly. I felt like I was balanced.
[1033.47s - 1033.95s] Yeah.
[1033.95s - 1035.39s] I felt like I was balanced.
[1035.39s - 1037.07s] We always feel like we're on that.
[1037.07s - 1040.35s] As the Buddha would say, as we talked about the middle path, like we always feel we're
[1040.35s - 1045.63s] on the middle path and everyone's lost and everyone else is confused.
[1045.63s - 1047.95s] Oh my gosh, that that celebrity is confused.
[1047.95s - 1049.23s] That person's on the wrong path.
[1049.23s - 1049.71s] I'm okay.
[1049.71s - 1053.79s] But you know, I really hope as you're listening to this, everyone that put yourself in those
[1053.79s - 1055.23s] shoes, put yourself in that mindset.
[1055.23s - 1057.95s] It's a healthy activity to do.
[1057.95s - 1062.11s] And you can learn something from the extremes also, right?
[1062.11s - 1073.12s] And when you when you look at the athletes, right, there's a certain extreme mindset that
[1074.38s - 1076.70s] you I was going to say you have to take on.
[1076.70s - 1078.62s] I don't know that you have to take it on.
[1078.62s - 1088.86s] What I do know is that in this society, we worship that mindset that, you know,
[1088.86s - 1094.50s] it's the can you become Michael Jordan without that mindset?
[1095.82s - 1103.82s] You know, and that is a that is a really powerful, difficult question.
[1103.82s - 1111.82s] It's like most people can't sustain the mindset that, you know, fortunately, because it's
[1112.54s - 1114.38s] it can be so destructive.
[1114.46s - 1121.18s] But most people can't sustain that level of discipline to manifest the things that they
[1121.18s - 1124.30s] want in in their life.
[1124.30s - 1133.04s] And there's just a there's a poisonous edge to that kind of discipline.
[1133.04s - 1139.20s] And I've been to the edge of that kind of material world discipline in my mind.
[1139.20s - 1143.84s] And I can tell you, you can have a whole lot of stuff and be miserable out there.
[1144.64s - 1145.92s] On that edge.
[1145.92s - 1152.48s] And I found a much more comfortable and productive space in my life.
[1152.48s - 1154.16s] And you still need that discipline.
[1154.16s - 1154.72s] Yes.
[1154.72s - 1160.64s] But it it's like when you're when you use that kind of power to achieve things,
[1161.44s - 1166.40s] it's like there's a there's a there's a brutal reckoning.
[1168.24s - 1171.44s] There's a brutal reckoning at the at the end of that.
[1171.44s - 1175.60s] But the amazing thing about you is you've been on that path in that direction.
[1175.60s - 1180.48s] I think people sometimes see these slips where they're like, oh, yeah, now that you are rich
[1180.48s - 1182.88s] and successful and famous, now you're going this way.
[1182.88s - 1187.60s] But actually, from our conversations and how you've shared with the family or even when we've
[1188.32s - 1193.52s] worked with some of the friends in your life, it's like, this has actually been a long process.
[1193.52s - 1195.92s] This isn't just 10, 12 months.
[1195.92s - 1197.52s] This isn't just a couple of years.
[1197.52s - 1201.28s] This is planted a seed from your grandmother through your whole
[1201.28s - 1207.04s] life to always be reminded of it to study spiritual paths, world religions, to study
[1207.60s - 1210.24s] philosophies like this is just a long process.
[1210.96s - 1214.32s] Tell me about that belief your grandmother had in you.
[1215.04s - 1218.16s] And tell me a bit about how she planted that deep seed.
[1218.16s - 1221.76s] Because I think what you said at the beginning that we need that example,
[1222.40s - 1227.04s] I think everyone, if they really reflected, there'd be someone in their life either indirectly
[1227.04s - 1228.00s] or directly.
[1228.00s - 1229.44s] But sometimes we forget them.
[1229.52s - 1233.68s] But when we've been talking everything, your grandmother's been such a pivotal figure.
[1233.68s - 1234.40s] Yeah, yeah.
[1234.40s - 1239.12s] I'd love for you to share what you think she did that was so powerful because maybe there are
[1239.12s - 1242.96s] some parents listening today and brothers and sisters and grandmothers and grandparents listening
[1242.96s - 1246.32s] today and they'll be able to do that for their children and grandchildren.
[1246.32s - 1252.24s] My father, my mother, and my grandmother, whenever I think about the three of them,
[1252.96s - 1258.16s] I picture a triangle in my mind.
[1258.16s - 1263.68s] And I see my father was the base as discipline.
[1264.32s - 1268.24s] And my mother didn't care about anything but education.
[1268.80s - 1273.68s] Like you had to learn, grow, study, travel.
[1274.80s - 1278.88s] My mother was really serious about educating the mind.
[1278.88s - 1286.72s] And my grandmother was love and God.
[1287.28s - 1291.68s] My grandmother was that grandmother at Resurrection Baptist Church.
[1291.68s - 1299.36s] And she had, you know, we were doing our Easter recitations and we was at the nativity, you know.
[1299.36s - 1307.44s] So she was that grandmother at the church and her life was deeply devoted to God.
[1309.04s - 1314.24s] And Jesus in the form of loving service, right?
[1314.24s - 1321.36s] So the form that it took was she was working hard to love everybody.
[1322.22s - 1329.50s] You know, I remember my grandmother bringing homeless people into our house when we were
[1329.50s - 1332.06s] little and washing them in our bathtub.
[1332.06s - 1334.06s] I thought that was the nastiest thing.
[1334.46s - 1342.78s] But she would be in the bathroom with her hands washing homeless people, you know.
[1342.78s - 1345.82s] And as a child, it was like, no.
[1348.30s - 1358.70s] But as I grew older, I just saw how dedicated and devoted she was to living her life in service.
[1359.66s - 1368.80s] It took me 50 years to figure out what the secret of that was, you know.
[1368.80s - 1383.84s] But it was, there was a day of her life that wasn't devoted to loving and serving, you know.
[1384.80s - 1386.16s] And I just watched her.
[1386.16s - 1393.04s] She worked the graveyard shift at the hospital and she watched us, my brothers and sisters,
[1393.04s - 1396.32s] during the day while my parents were at work, you know.
[1396.32s - 1399.44s] And then when my parents got off work, then she went, she would take a little nap
[1399.44s - 1401.84s] and then she would go to work at the hospital, you know.
[1401.84s - 1409.92s] And she was the just the happiest person that I had ever met.
[1409.92s - 1411.12s] Nothing faced her.
[1411.12s - 1411.92s] She was okay.
[1413.60s - 1417.92s] And I remember I was about 12 and I had started rapping.
[1419.26s - 1421.02s] And you know, so I had my rap books.
[1421.02s - 1424.22s] I had all my little curse words and everything in my rap book.
[1425.02s - 1429.42s] And she found my rap book and she never said anything and she just opened the cover
[1429.42s - 1431.82s] and she wrote a letter to me.
[1433.50s - 1439.82s] Dear Willard, truly intelligent people do not have to use words like this to
[1440.54s - 1441.66s] express themselves.
[1442.78s - 1445.66s] God has given you the gift of words.
[1446.70s - 1450.30s] Be sure to use those words to uplift people.
[1451.17s - 1456.93s] And you know, I was sitting, I was reading that and just love Gigi.
[1457.73s - 1465.57s] And you know, that was part of the reason why I never used profanity in any of my music.
[1466.29s - 1475.41s] And it was like she missionized me in that way to make sure that what I was doing was
[1475.41s - 1478.77s] uplifting others, you know.
[1478.77s - 1484.93s] And when you're telling stories, you can always find the part of the story that is
[1484.93s - 1490.05s] a gift for the potential upliftment of somebody that would see it, you know.
[1490.05s - 1494.69s] So, but yeah, she was all God, all love.
[1495.57s - 1496.21s] I love that man.
[1496.21s - 1497.41s] That's such a beautiful story.
[1497.41s - 1498.45s] I hadn't heard that one before.
[1498.45s - 1500.45s] Oh, we had talked about, yeah, we had talked about that one.
[1500.45s - 1505.73s] When your grandmother finds your rap book and you got curse words in it, it's a bad look.
[1505.73s - 1507.17s] It's a bad look.
[1507.17s - 1512.53s] It's good that you found it that early and that had such an impact on you and brought you out.
[1512.53s - 1520.32s] Where was the, as you started to grow in that success and that journey and you decided you
[1520.32s - 1524.24s] wanted everything you do to have a positive impact on others, whether it was music and then
[1524.24s - 1525.60s] movies.
[1525.60s - 1533.52s] And then that journey led you to just tell us about the hard work and graft that went
[1533.52s - 1538.72s] into the creation of what you said earlier, which was like, I was working so hard and my
[1538.72s - 1540.40s] family hated me and this didn't work.
[1540.40s - 1546.56s] But tell us about that hard work because I think sometimes it's forgotten and it's,
[1546.56s - 1553.94s] you know, it's almost like you don't realize how when I started spending closer time with you and
[1554.02s - 1560.18s] started seeing you on set and in the trailer and then you'd walk out and in two seconds
[1560.18s - 1565.30s] you'd be in character and then you'd walk back in and you'd be will again.
[1565.30s - 1569.86s] And then and then we were in your man cave and you have your, you have the movie plotted out
[1569.86s - 1572.50s] and you'd walk me through like how that tells you what.
[1572.50s - 1581.06s] And I started to understand and appreciate that what you do is a science and it is strategic
[1581.06s - 1586.26s] and systematic and it is a skill you have worked on for decades and decades and decades.
[1586.26s - 1592.02s] You start to realize that the external view of like Will's charismatic and he's cool and
[1592.02s - 1597.54s] you start to realize like, yes, but that is underpinned with just hard work.
[1598.50s - 1602.82s] And I think that that's a real awakening that a lot of people don't get to experience
[1603.38s - 1607.46s] when they see you on a big screen because you don't see all of that there.
[1607.46s - 1613.30s] You don't see the learning of the lines and you have a phenomenal memory like you,
[1613.30s - 1617.30s] you know, we're studying spiritual books together and you can remember stuff
[1617.30s - 1620.10s] that you've read that day and that comes from all your years of training.
[1620.10s - 1624.74s] And even your ability when we first met and you said, Jay, I'm an actor, you know,
[1624.74s - 1629.78s] when we're direct, just direct me and we can do this because I can drop into a student mindset.
[1629.78s - 1632.42s] So so much of this is internalized.
[1632.42s - 1636.90s] It's not tell us a bit about how long it took to learn all of this and start
[1636.90s - 1641.42s] playing with it beyond just thinking, oh, yeah, I've got this because I can act.
[1641.42s - 1647.50s] You know, I grew up in a military household and, you know, while there, you know,
[1647.50s - 1657.18s] there are certain emotional drawbacks to that, there are intellectual and organizational
[1657.74s - 1669.58s] pluses that are, you know, hard, hard to beat. So, you know, my father was really, you know,
[1670.14s - 1682.69s] strict on order organization and the incremental completion of tasks, you know,
[1683.41s - 1692.19s] and, you know, also combined with my mother's push on on education as a really young child,
[1692.19s - 1698.03s] you know, we had to put hospital corners on our beds and our shoes were lined up, you know.
[1698.03s - 1708.03s] So, you know, at at six years old, we were we were forced to think along those military lines.
[1708.99s - 1715.66s] And everything was a mission to my father. Like, you know, never there was nothing that was
[1717.34s - 1724.46s] a basic task. You weren't just going to wash the dishes. You know, it was a mission, you know,
[1724.46s - 1733.50s] that had to be completed with, you know, military precision, you know, down to how much
[1733.58s - 1738.70s] dishwashing liquid you're using and how much the bottle cost and if you use that much and how
[1738.70s - 1746.46s] many dishes do you wash with that amount of dishwashing liquid and how long are you going to
[1746.46s - 1752.06s] be able to use this dishwashing bottle so you can relate that to how much work you have to do
[1752.06s - 1764.70s] to be able to wash that many. Your dad sounds Indian. That's more intense. Yeah, you know,
[1764.70s - 1770.54s] so it was really, you know, his mind was like that and I took, you know, we always take the
[1770.54s - 1778.86s] things we hate the most from our parents. But, you know, from that, the gift of structure and the
[1778.86s - 1785.34s] gift of breaking tasks down, you know, you set, you know, you set the goal, but the breaking the
[1785.34s - 1794.14s] tasks down into smaller manageable pieces was a thing that I came out of my childhood with.
[1795.50s - 1801.26s] You know, for example, you met JL. Yeah, so I told when I said I wanted to,
[1801.26s - 1806.54s] I wanted to be the biggest movie star in the world, you know, and I was 18 or something.
[1806.54s - 1809.42s] I haven't met him yet. I know you do. I haven't met him yet. Yeah, I know you do.
[1809.42s - 1813.58s] When I said I wanted to be the biggest movie star in the world.
[1813.58s - 1822.08s] So the first thing that we did is we looked at, okay, well, what are the top 10 movies of all
[1822.08s - 1825.76s] time? Because if you want to be the biggest movie star in the world, you're going to have to
[1826.64s - 1831.12s] make the biggest movies in the world. So we said, well, what are the top 10 movies? So we
[1831.12s - 1835.36s] looked at the top 10 movies. We said, well, what are the patterns? What are the patterns
[1835.36s - 1841.60s] in the top 10 movies? And at the time, 10 out of 10 were special effects movies.
[1842.40s - 1850.72s] And nine out of 10 were special effects movies with creatures. And eight out of 10 were special
[1850.72s - 1859.04s] effects movies with creatures and a love story. So, you know, for that's where the bent for me
[1859.04s - 1867.28s] towards sci-fi movies came from the recognition of the patterns of sci-fi creatures and a love
[1867.28s - 1873.84s] story. So that became what we were looking for with everything. And then Independence Day was
[1873.84s - 1882.00s] a no brainer and then Men in Black was, you know, behind that. And it's that kind of
[1882.96s - 1889.20s] systemized algorithm. Yes, right. Exactly. Looking for what's the what is the pattern,
[1889.20s - 1895.25s] you know, and that's that's, you know, one of the one of the gifts my father
[1896.77s - 1901.17s] stuck me with coming coming out of childhood. Yeah, this is one of my favorite parts about
[1901.17s - 1908.53s] talking to you because of this ability to turn those into gifts. Yeah. And I want to just emphasize
[1908.53s - 1911.81s] that point to everyone who's listening and watching again, because I think we're living
[1911.81s - 1917.95s] in a time right now where there's a lot of bitterness towards parents and what we received.
[1917.95s - 1924.03s] And some and rightly so as well, like some things are, you know, quite hard to deal with that level
[1924.03s - 1929.39s] of trauma, etc. But at the same time, when we start looking at our lives this way, not in a not in a
[1929.39s - 1934.43s] fake way or in genuine way, but but really start to process some of these things to see the powers
[1934.43s - 1939.15s] that it gave us. Absolutely. All the superheroes that we all love in sci-fi movies, they all got
[1939.15s - 1942.59s] their powers from bad things that happened to them. Exactly. No one ever had something good
[1942.59s - 1947.87s] happen to them. And then they like for Spider-Man, he got bit by Spider-Man for this person,
[1947.87s - 1952.19s] like got abandoned by his parents, like all the superheroes we all love and worship
[1952.19s - 1956.99s] all got their powers from something bad happening to them. You know, it's really difficult to
[1957.71s - 1964.11s] say that to someone. Yeah. In the in the middle of the the throws and you should have had an
[1964.11s - 1972.43s] experience. We've talked about that. Right. But you know, from sitting on this side of the
[1972.43s - 1980.99s] experiences that I've shared, you know, in in my life and in my experience,
[1984.18s - 1991.01s] there's there's there's no such thing as a bad experience. Right. There's experiences you don't
[1991.01s - 1997.81s] like. And they hurt. And they hurt. Right. But to define something as a bad experience
[2000.02s - 2010.02s] for for me has not been true. Everything that's ever happened to me in my life that at the time
[2012.66s - 2019.62s] was deeply traumatic and and debilitating. You know, there's there's, you know, been only
[2019.62s - 2027.54s] two times in my life when I contemplated suicide. Wow. You know, there's been two times in my life.
[2028.90s - 2037.86s] You know, the the the once was when my my mother and father separated when my parents broke up.
[2037.86s - 2045.86s] And you know, I was 12. And you know, that was one of the only, you know, serious times in my life
[2045.86s - 2057.57s] that I contemplated suicide. But even out of that, as I look back on that, the pain of that
[2057.57s - 2069.31s] experience cultivated devotion in my life to my family. And I just never wanted to
[2070.46s - 2078.62s] have my children suffer that. And of course, the, you know, that got divorced with from Cherise.
[2078.62s - 2089.26s] So that was I was recreating that situation. But it woke me up in a way that forced me to try to
[2090.54s - 2097.58s] connect with my children. So the negative experiences or the things that were awful
[2097.66s - 2106.32s] at the time, you know, there's there's always the other side of the coin. And in my experience,
[2106.96s - 2114.83s] I've cultivated only positive things out of the most negative experiences
[2115.95s - 2125.10s] of my life. My my my father's death and the six weeks up to my father's death was probably the
[2125.10s - 2130.46s] most formative time in my life. And as painful as it was, and as difficult as it was, and all the
[2130.46s - 2140.30s] stuff that came up during the time, I still it it was a powerful, formative, positive experience
[2140.30s - 2145.52s] in my life. Tell us a bit about that. If you don't mind about why you felt it was formative.
[2145.52s - 2150.40s] And because I think a lot of people go through the loss of their parents. And you know, we've
[2150.40s - 2154.80s] talked about this, like the idea of like, sometimes people regret of what they did or didn't say to
[2154.80s - 2160.40s] their parents or maybe what they expected of their parent. What was it that was so powerful
[2160.40s - 2167.76s] that allowed you to feel that way about that moment? Because I got I got a gift that some people
[2168.88s - 2177.46s] don't get. And it was that the doctors told us he had six weeks to live. Right. So and then he
[2177.46s - 2186.67s] lived for four months. Right. So I got a warning. So most people, you know, most people don't get a
[2186.67s - 2194.35s] warning, you just get the call one day, and you just you just didn't get a chance. And when I found
[2194.35s - 2203.15s] out that he was dying, it just by the grace of God was in the middle of the shooting, I was doing
[2203.15s - 2209.55s] a movie called Collateral Beauty. And it was about a guy dealing with the death of his daughter.
[2210.11s - 2218.83s] So I was into the Tibetan book of living and dying and reading all the was it Elizabeth Kubler,
[2219.63s - 2225.31s] just reading all the all this stuff about death. So I've been programmed for six months. And I had
[2225.31s - 2230.75s] read and studied all of this, all these books about death and grief and dying. And then I get the
[2230.75s - 2239.63s] message. And I was like, I sat down with my father. And of course, I had all of my traumas
[2239.63s - 2245.15s] and all of my issues and everything with him. But I had also been six months of programming
[2245.15s - 2252.11s] of all of the things that you're supposed to do, you know, to prepare yourself for the death of a
[2252.11s - 2260.45s] loved one. And, you know, so I sat with him and we talked about everything. So I said everything
[2260.45s - 2265.73s] that I wanted to say. And we got to those six weeks. And when we got to those six weeks,
[2268.42s - 2278.30s] we were clear. But then he lived for another three months. So what happened was every
[2279.54s - 2284.74s] meeting, every time I saw him, I was flying back to LA. But every, every time I saw him,
[2285.70s - 2293.14s] was like, Oh, thank God. And then every time we said goodbye, we made sure we said a good,
[2293.14s - 2298.26s] thorough, full goodbye, because we knew at any moment that it could actually be the last goodbye.
[2299.22s - 2310.22s] Right. And, but the lesson was, it's always like that. When we say goodbye, we can't know if this
[2310.22s - 2316.70s] is the last time we will ever see, you should never greet someone casually or say goodbye to
[2316.70s - 2325.81s] someone casually. And that lesson came from that experience. Every moment was so rich. Every time
[2325.81s - 2333.87s] we saw each other. And every time we said goodbye, we made sure it was a good, thorough, full goodbye.
[2334.91s - 2339.23s] That's how you're supposed to live every day. Anyway, every time you leave your house could be
[2339.23s - 2346.19s] the last time. You're supposed to like be in the richness of your hellos and goodbyes and thank
[2346.19s - 2355.49s] yous, you know. And, you know, so I learned that lesson with my father. And then when he, when he
[2355.49s - 2369.44s] passed, it was easy. We were, we were finished, you know, and just the lesson of that kind of
[2369.44s - 2376.72s] presence and that kind of attention and that kind of recognition that tomorrow's not promised,
[2376.72s - 2382.00s] you know, and just getting, getting shaken out of thinking that you're going to have,
[2382.96s - 2389.68s] you know, tomorrow, anybody who hasn't spoken to their parents or their brother or their
[2390.56s - 2396.96s] cousin that they had a thing with or their ex and they don't talk anymore, call them right now.
[2398.66s - 2406.74s] You just don't like, don't think you're going to have a chance to call them to tomorrow or next
[2406.74s - 2414.90s] week. And it's like that, that opportunity with my father changed every relationship in my life.
[2414.90s - 2423.22s] I cleaned all of the relationships in my life to no regret. I do not want someone to be gone and I
[2423.22s - 2430.02s] wish I had and wish I could have and I'm just, I'm not doing that in my life. That's beautiful, man.
[2430.02s - 2434.18s] Thank you for sharing that. That's just, hearing you say that, I think there's a lot of people who
[2434.18s - 2438.42s] needed to hear that and are hoping everyone's going to pick up the phone and message. And if
[2438.42s - 2442.82s] that person's not here anymore, still write them a letter, right? If they're not here anymore and
[2442.82s - 2447.38s] you didn't get a sale of that, write a letter, read it out to them, read it to a picture of them,
[2447.38s - 2453.78s] if that's what it takes. Allow yourself to share and express. Don't hold it in and hold it back
[2453.78s - 2459.86s] because somehow that energy will still reach that person and that energy's left you too. So
[2459.94s - 2466.50s] absolutely. Even if you can't call someone up today, make sure you still follow the same practice
[2466.50s - 2474.21s] because yeah, it's just not, it's never worth it. It's never worth it. It's just never worth it.
[2474.21s - 2481.57s] Never worth it. And I love that idea of valuing each hello and goodbye and not taking it for granted
[2481.57s - 2486.37s] or taking it lightly. You never know whatever's going to happen, right? You just have no idea and
[2486.93s - 2492.77s] unfortunately we see it. This is the, there's actually a beautiful, I don't know if we ever
[2492.77s - 2496.93s] talked about this, there's a beautiful piece in the Mahabharat which is the Gita's a small part of
[2497.73s - 2503.01s] and one of the students asked the teacher, he said, what's the most amazing thing in the world?
[2503.01s - 2509.28s] Like what's the most incredible thing in the world? And the teacher responds and says, the most
[2509.28s - 2515.84s] incredible amazing thing in the world is that we see people leave all around us, but we never think
[2515.84s - 2521.20s] it's going to be us. So you see it and you have that moment again and again and then you lose someone
[2521.20s - 2524.64s] in your life and you think, oh that could be me or that could be someone else and you live like
[2524.64s - 2530.96s] that for a day and then the complacency sets back in. Absolutely. Tell us a bit about, you know,
[2530.96s - 2536.72s] you've been studying world religions and spiritual paths for a long time and the first time I
[2537.52s - 2541.76s] officially reached out to you and your team and everyone, which was a few years back now,
[2542.32s - 2546.48s] was because I saw that you'd been reading the Gita and the Gita was obviously the book that I
[2546.48s - 2552.16s] read and studied so deeply and fell in love with and after having studied world religions myself
[2552.16s - 2557.60s] too and I've had beautiful experiences reading the Bible and the Quran and the Gita and so
[2557.60s - 2562.64s] when I saw you talking about it when you were in India, I was just like, wow, like this is amazing,
[2562.64s - 2567.52s] like I'm already a huge fan, I love Will Smith, like how is Will reading the Gita? I was like,
[2567.52s - 2571.20s] how did that even happen? And then when I got to know you and Jada and spoke to the family,
[2571.20s - 2576.56s] I realized that you'd taken on a challenge to like study a world religion every year and
[2576.56s - 2580.32s] tell us about that and what you learned along the way. What were some of the traditions that
[2580.32s - 2586.80s] stood out in your journey and what did you learn from them, whether it was the Kabbalah or even
[2586.80s - 2591.12s] Scientology, all those because you've shared so many beautiful lessons with me from what you've
[2591.12s - 2601.25s] studied and I'd love to pass them on. So what was, I guess probably in the first 10 years
[2601.81s - 2612.05s] of our marriage, that was me and Jada's bonding, right? So every year we would pick a spiritual
[2612.05s - 2618.61s] tradition and we would study it all the way through. How did you even start doing that?
[2618.61s - 2622.45s] Like, because when I hit, when I heard you did that, I think Jada told me first and
[2623.01s - 2628.13s] when I heard you did that, I was just like, I was, I was just, it just took me back because
[2628.85s - 2634.29s] I've almost, you don't come across that all the time and I was lucky enough to study world
[2634.29s - 2639.97s] religions. My father started encouraging me when I was about 14 to start reading spiritual books
[2640.69s - 2646.29s] and I dated a Muslim girl who asked me to read the Quran. That's how I read the Quran,
[2646.29s - 2651.49s] which was a wonderful experience of my life at 16. I read the Bible because we would celebrate
[2651.49s - 2658.05s] Christmas and I'd feel guilty that we celebrated Christmas but I hadn't read the Bible. So I started
[2658.05s - 2662.85s] to go to church on Christmas and then reading about Christ and the Bible and I just absolutely
[2662.85s - 2666.77s] fell in love with the scripture and then I was just reading so many different books and finally
[2666.77s - 2671.09s] I came back to the Gita, which was the book I was brought up with. But yeah, telling me about even
[2671.09s - 2678.69s] why you and Jada decided to do that. So I don't even know how it developed as a thing. I know
[2679.33s - 2691.82s] when we got married, we were trying to decide what church we were going to get married and
[2691.82s - 2698.78s] where we're going to get married in Baltimore or Philly and who was going to be the priest.
[2700.54s - 2707.90s] And so Gami had a different religious background than Gigi. So we were trying to figure all of that
[2708.22s - 2714.62s] stuff out and Jada didn't want to do any of that. Jada wanted for she and I to go to a mountain
[2716.30s - 2727.34s] and pledge our love and devotion to one another to God without... She felt like we weren't going to
[2730.03s - 2736.11s] adhere to this specific religious tradition. We would just be picking it for
[2736.51s - 2746.19s] her mother or my grandmother or something to try to figure that out. So I think the discussion
[2746.19s - 2751.79s] about the religious background we would raise our children in is what came up
[2752.99s - 2760.03s] when we first got married. And she grew up in a thing called the Ethical Society
[2760.51s - 2769.23s] in Baltimore and they would honor the different religions. And my background, I grew up. I went
[2769.23s - 2778.83s] to a Baptist church. I went to a Catholic school and somewhere in that first decade of our marriage,
[2778.83s - 2786.11s] we were like, oh, wouldn't it be hot if we could say that we had read cover to cover all of the
[2786.19s - 2796.42s] major holy books? And we started with the Bible and I just remember seeing her Bible was,
[2797.14s - 2801.22s] you know how I do my books now, you see how I like all my books are highlighted all the way through.
[2801.78s - 2814.26s] And she completed the entire Bible seven months before me. So now it's on. So then when it came
[2814.26s - 2824.90s] time for the Quran, I was like, I wanted to win. So we would take a year and we would study
[2825.46s - 2835.30s] all of these traditions as a way of the two of us bonding spiritually and intellectually
[2835.30s - 2843.38s] around the concepts. And, you know, we went through Kabbalah and, you know, Scientology. And
[2843.38s - 2848.90s] really what was happening is every time I would meet someone who was of a different tradition,
[2849.54s - 2858.42s] I would allow that person to introduce me to what their tradition was. And then I did Ali.
[2858.98s - 2869.70s] And so we circled back around to the Quran during that time. But we really just, we love the idea of
[2872.24s - 2883.07s] spirituality and the study of the love of God. And we don't necessarily believe in organized
[2883.07s - 2891.95s] religion. We believe that the organizations kind of jump ahead of the spirituality. You know, the
[2894.85s - 2902.37s] Church of Christ is very different than Christ. The steps that Christ actually walked. So we
[2902.37s - 2908.53s] started to notice those kinds of differences. And we just, we really just wanted to find
[2909.41s - 2916.11s] the truth. You know, what is the truth? And you see how my whole family dives in. The kids are
[2916.11s - 2926.27s] doing it now, you know, with the Gita. And it's really just trying to find our way, you know,
[2926.27s - 2932.75s] in this world. Yeah. And I loved that. And I was sort of fascinated by that myself because
[2932.75s - 2938.27s] I saw that within myself. And so when I saw it with you and the family, I was so drawn
[2938.35s - 2944.27s] to that because, yeah, I think that a lot of what we're trying to figure out in today's world
[2944.91s - 2950.91s] has been suffered for long enough in an internal way that when you're diving into these books of
[2950.91s - 2956.75s] wisdom, there's just so much there to an earth because people have been through the same challenges
[2956.75s - 2963.79s] for decades and decades and decades. The problems have already been solved. Yeah. And lived. And
[2964.03s - 2978.82s] solved, you know. And at the core of all of the, you know, the spiritual teachings that I've ever
[2978.82s - 2992.72s] studied at the core of all of the ideas, how you treat your neighbor is central, right? Yes,
[2992.72s - 3002.82s] absolutely. Yet somehow people manage to twist, you know, in all faiths and all backgrounds.
[3002.82s - 3012.78s] Totally. People do unto others as you would have them do unto you is very clear. If you ask yourself
[3012.78s - 3020.54s] that question, well, in this situation, how would I have them do unto me? And you did that,
[3020.62s - 3027.50s] you'd never have a problem. Because the answer is never going to be, I think they should curse
[3027.50s - 3036.94s] me out and spit on me and whoop my ass because I was tripping. It's like, you just, you know,
[3036.94s - 3042.30s] I mean, I guess somebody. Yeah, maybe. No, no, no. I think you're right. I think you're right.
[3042.30s - 3051.49s] If I were in this situation, how would I want them to treat me? Right? It's huge. It's the most
[3051.49s - 3060.85s] simple yet the most profound. Our teachers in the ashram would always tell us, and I've said
[3060.85s - 3066.45s] this to you before, but they'd always tell us that these principles, you'll learn them on day one.
[3066.45s - 3071.33s] You'll think that you know them on day two, but you spend your whole life trying to realize
[3071.41s - 3076.37s] yes. And that's the challenge with us, that we take what we learn on day one and what we know
[3076.37s - 3081.57s] on day two to be like, I already know that. Yes, exactly. And then the teaching doesn't,
[3081.57s - 3087.89s] what I love about what we've been doing is like, the teaching gets to like, reveal itself to you.
[3087.89s - 3093.33s] It's like, it's always opening up. It's like a lotus flower. It's always blooming. It's not like,
[3093.33s - 3097.81s] oh, it's open now. It doesn't matter. It's like always opening up to you. And if you give it that
[3097.81s - 3103.25s] time and patience, then you can truly see it grow and bloom into something. But if you just,
[3103.97s - 3108.61s] if you just try and force it open, it just, I mean, you know, if you force the flower open,
[3108.61s - 3114.69s] it would just break. And that's what happens. What I say, what I say to you all the time is,
[3115.41s - 3122.29s] you know, to give people a sense of it. So we're, we were doing, you know,
[3123.31s - 3134.91s] two to four hours a day, you know, a few days a week for months, for months, you know. And,
[3135.79s - 3142.35s] you know, we were spending as much time together as we were would spend with our families or
[3142.35s - 3149.95s] other things. So we, we, we've logged some real hours in this, in this last year. And the thing
[3149.95s - 3158.35s] that was always amazing to me is that we could take eight hours, right? And we spend it and we
[3158.35s - 3165.39s] get it and we study, we do all of that. And you leave my house and I pick up my phone. How quickly
[3165.39s - 3177.46s] somebody could snatch me. I was like, and it really is a serious moment to moment practice to
[3177.46s - 3187.94s] remember to be nice to people where you get sucked back into the foolishness so hard and so fast.
[3188.58s - 3195.78s] And that was frustrating to me for a while. Like, like literally we would do eight hours.
[3198.42s - 3207.14s] And I'm great. I'm great. And you wouldn't be off of this off of the block yet. And I pick up my phone
[3207.14s - 3216.02s] and it's a business call and literally that fast, like literally in, in 45 seconds, my mind could get
[3216.02s - 3224.82s] triggered back into that, that mindset. You know, I know now that that's just, it's every day. Yeah.
[3224.82s - 3230.90s] It's, you don't, you know, you don't get to know it and be done. Like it's a, it's a daily practice
[3230.90s - 3237.62s] for the rest of your life to be able to deal with the foolishness of this world
[3238.18s - 3245.06s] in a way that's productive and kind. Yeah. Now everyone knows I'm terrible at what I do.
[3247.06s - 3253.78s] It's like, as soon as you have the new idea, it's like, oh wow, like Jay, you're really bad at this.
[3253.78s - 3256.82s] Say, oh, Jay, you should have left Will with a little more girth than that.
[3257.78s - 3260.42s] You can't even last two seconds with that. That's terrible.
[3261.62s - 3267.46s] Well, you're, you're, you're, you're working with years of, of sediment, you know.
[3267.46s - 3274.18s] All of us lifetimes, like the conditioning is so strong. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's almost like
[3274.18s - 3280.50s] when we start to do the work, you're walking into a garden full of weeds. Yeah. Yeah. So all the
[3280.50s - 3285.94s] flowers are covered. All the beauty of the garden is covered in weeds. And so you're cutting down
[3285.94s - 3289.38s] the weeds. But because you've been watering the weeds for so long, they keep growing back.
[3289.38s - 3292.98s] They keep growing, yeah. And so you keep cutting them down and they keep growing back. And it's,
[3292.98s - 3298.10s] it's the example, the analogy of the mirror that's given in the Vedic tradition around
[3298.10s - 3302.90s] how when you walk in and you try and clean a mirror that hasn't been cleaned for lifetimes,
[3302.90s - 3306.82s] it's dusty. And so when you start cleaning it, the dust comes up in your face and you're like,
[3306.82s - 3312.50s] oh, I can't see. I can't, I can't see. And that's what we're all going through. And
[3313.46s - 3317.78s] when we start realizing what you just said the day to day, it's like, if you, if all of us said,
[3317.78s - 3323.46s] we want to plant, I keep using gardening analogies, but it's only because it makes so much sense. I
[3323.46s - 3329.62s] feel because we're so disconnected from nature, our mindset has become instant. Yeah. And our
[3329.62s - 3335.70s] mindset has become now. Whereas when you watch nature, nature's never instant. Yeah. I call that
[3335.70s - 3342.66s] hunting versus farming. Right. Okay. Hunting versus farming where people just like, just, just,
[3342.66s - 3348.98s] just get it. Let's get it and eat. Right. That's the great. I love that. I love that. You know,
[3348.98s - 3354.58s] versus now we're going to like, we're going to plant the crops. I love that. Yeah. Because it's,
[3355.22s - 3361.38s] it's, it's the idea that if you, if me and you said we want to plant a tree, you'd have to come
[3361.38s - 3366.50s] back to that tree every day to see how it was doing. Yeah. And it wouldn't be a tree for many,
[3366.50s - 3371.22s] many years, but you'd have to come back every day, water it, sunlight, move it, replant the soil.
[3371.22s - 3374.98s] And that's what we're doing with ourselves. But for some reason, because we're so disconnected
[3374.98s - 3380.90s] from nature now, we think that, oh, if I just meditate today, then it's, you know, it's like
[3380.90s - 3385.86s] saying, oh, I'll eat today and I don't have to eat tomorrow. Yeah. Or I showered last week.
[3385.86s - 3391.62s] I'm good. Yeah. But, but yeah, it's, you know, and I, again, it was your commitment. I remember
[3391.62s - 3394.98s] when we were on that first phone call and I was like, you were like, oh, yeah, I want to work on
[3394.98s - 3398.82s] this. I was like, how much time do you have? Like, how much time do you have? And I, you know,
[3398.82s - 3403.30s] you will smith something and you don't have any time. And, and I don't know how serious you get
[3403.30s - 3410.26s] yet. I'm not, I'm not aware yet of how, how immersed you get with stuff. I'm still learning
[3410.26s - 3414.26s] about you. And then you're like, I've got two hours and I was like, two hours a week, two hours
[3414.34s - 3420.34s] biweekly, two hours monthly. You're like, no, two hours a day. And I was like, wow, he's real.
[3420.34s - 3425.06s] I was like, he's serious. I was like, wow, he's, he's for real. And then, you know, it was just,
[3425.78s - 3433.54s] it was, and I'd go away and you reinspired so much of my own study. And that's what I was
[3433.54s - 3438.90s] telling to you over Christmas, which is when we kind of broke off as I went to London and, and
[3438.98s - 3444.98s] you've been traveling. It's like, I spend the whole of Christmas reading myself for four to eight
[3444.98s - 3450.10s] hours a day meditating again. That's beautiful. Because I felt I had to be more to give you more.
[3450.10s - 3456.42s] That's beautiful. And I think that that was such a gift you gave me where I felt back in love
[3457.14s - 3461.14s] with what I fell in love with years ago. That's beautiful. Because of the work we were doing.
[3461.14s - 3466.10s] Yeah. And because when you're answering someone's questions, you have to read deeper and think more
[3466.18s - 3471.30s] and reflect more. And so for me, I went away from those meetings going, gosh, I, you know,
[3471.30s - 3477.30s] I better start reading more. But it, that's what's so beautiful about sharing something like that
[3477.30s - 3486.40s] together. It was great when, uh, with the Radhanath Swami, when, when, uh, you told him that you were
[3486.40s - 3492.96s] going to be working with me. And I just loved his response. You say, Oh, that is so great.
[3492.96s - 3495.84s] You're going to get to teach all of the things you need to learn.
[3495.84s - 3502.88s] Yeah. I remember. I was, I was just telling him, I was like, I was, I was explaining to him how
[3502.88s - 3508.24s] sincere you are. And I was like, you know, he's so serious and he's sincere. And that's what he came
[3508.24s - 3513.04s] back with. You know, that's when you know, you've got a good teacher. He knows how to like squash your
[3513.04s - 3519.84s] ego and make you realize how small you are. And it was beautiful because from that moment, that was
[3519.84s - 3524.40s] my attitude when I was meeting you. I was like, I'm saying this for me. I'm saying this, you know,
[3524.40s - 3531.28s] and that allows you to be so much more, um, just allows you to get out of the way and let wisdom
[3531.28s - 3544.83s] do its work. Yeah. That's so real. This, the central, um, problem that has been the focus of my life
[3545.63s - 3556.93s] and everything that I've done has been centered on, um, having a successful love relationship.
[3557.65s - 3563.97s] Right. So I saw my parents when, when they were growing up and I hated that my parents,
[3564.85s - 3572.69s] marriage deteriorated. And, um, you know, as young as I can remember, five, six years old,
[3572.69s - 3580.21s] I wanted to be married. I wanted to have a family. Um, I've never been the guy that, that, you know,
[3581.17s - 3586.13s] wanted to do threesomes and groupies. And I like, I just, I've never been that guy. I always
[3587.17s - 3598.46s] wanted to, uh, commit and have a single successful relationship. So the, the, the scientist in my
[3598.46s - 3603.50s] mind and in my study of spiritual texts and things like that, I've always been looking
[3603.50s - 3612.14s] for the secret to, um, successful, uh, love relationships. And then as I've grown, it's
[3612.14s - 3618.94s] sort of expanded and I'm seeing the through line, uh, oh, the same basic ideas are a successful
[3618.94s - 3624.86s] parenting and the same basic ideas are being, uh, successful follower or a successful leader
[3624.86s - 3634.48s] or a successful student. And I started to see the central issues with all of human relating.
[3634.48s - 3644.24s] And it's, it's the, the problems or it's not even problems. The problem is really singular in,
[3644.24s - 3650.72s] if you're talking about a husband and a wife or you're talking about a, a parent and a child
[3650.72s - 3660.08s] or a Democrat and a Republican or, uh, a, you know, a Saudi and an American, whatever,
[3660.08s - 3671.36s] in all of the configurations of, of human difficulty at the, at the center of it is almost
[3671.36s - 3681.50s] exclusively a lack of understanding of the other person's perspective. Right. And you know, it
[3681.50s - 3693.41s] sounds simple and it may oversimplify slightly, but the, the, the concept of ignorance, the concepts
[3693.41s - 3702.93s] of ignorance and delusion are always the problem. Right. It's, it's always the center. If you have
[3702.93s - 3712.22s] a difficulty with another human being, there's some point of ignorance and some point of delusion
[3712.78s - 3721.31s] that are keeping you from being able on both sides, right. And the, the problem is you can only
[3721.31s - 3728.43s] worry about yours. You have to clear yours. And then once you clear yours and your vision gets,
[3729.15s - 3740.19s] uh, clean and purified and you approach a person from a purified space, things get a whole lot
[3740.19s - 3748.91s] easier, you know, and it's like you're all, you're, you are always bringing poison to the party.
[3750.30s - 3755.74s] And when you recognize that in any difficulty you're having with any human being,
[3756.70s - 3767.33s] you brought poison to the party. Right. And if you can focus on locating and purifying
[3768.13s - 3776.29s] the, the poison you brought, it opens up entirely new avenues of connection and compromise and
[3776.29s - 3785.89s] solutions that you can create with a person. And you know, that has really been the, the central
[3785.89s - 3793.97s] focus of my life and being an actor has been spectacular in that way because my life is
[3793.97s - 3801.10s] exploring my mind, you know, and changing it. Right. When I play a character who believes
[3801.10s - 3809.34s] something that I don't believe, I have to learn how to feel something that's in opposition to
[3810.54s - 3821.26s] my truth, which is a spectacular skill set to have to uproot beliefs, implant new ideas,
[3822.14s - 3829.74s] and have them blossom on camera at the right moment. You know, it's been such a, a powerful
[3831.18s - 3839.58s] inner process of development to explore acting in conjunction with spirituality and
[3839.58s - 3848.38s] supreme absolute truth, you know, to explore that as my job is fantastic. Everyone should be trained
[3848.38s - 3852.46s] as an actor. When you first said that to me, when you first said that to me, I was like,
[3853.10s - 3856.46s] I never thought of it. And obviously I'm not an actor. And so I wouldn't know that, but
[3857.10s - 3860.86s] when you said that to me, I was like, wow, that's like how people should be taught how to be
[3860.94s - 3869.18s] students. Right. Because the idea that you have the skill set and it's a skill to put your beliefs
[3869.18s - 3874.14s] aside. Yes. And go, I need to live by the beliefs that this character would die for. Absolutely.
[3874.14s - 3877.90s] And what would they be willing to die for? Yes. And then you're experimenting with it. And then
[3877.90s - 3881.50s] you can see whether you like it or not. Right. Absolutely. And how it feels. Whereas most of
[3881.50s - 3886.62s] us are so grounded in our own beliefs that we don't know how to take that hat off and put another
[3886.62s - 3891.82s] one on. Absolutely. And that's where all of our issues come from, because that story of someone
[3891.82s - 3898.06s] else. Yeah. Someone that you know that did that extremely well in probably the most difficult
[3898.06s - 3903.34s] circumstances with Nelson Mandela. Yes. Absolutely. You know, we've spoken about it many times.
[3903.34s - 3908.14s] You've spoken about it in publicly many times. I found this clip of you guys together. Oh, no,
[3908.14s - 3914.30s] yeah. That I love. That I have to show you. It's a while ago, but it's really, I've watched this
[3914.30s - 3918.06s] whole thing. Anyone who's watching, you have to go watch the whole thing. I'm only showing Will
[3918.06s - 3931.20s] a short clip that that is this clip here. I was saying to you, I'm an actor. I make rap music.
[3931.20s - 3937.28s] That's what I do. What can I do? And you know, I sat with Mr. Mandela was so inspired, you know,
[3937.28s - 3940.96s] you want to immediately you want to quit your job, you know, you want to go out in the streets,
[3941.04s - 3947.44s] you know, you want to fight. He said, he said, no, you have to understand the power
[3948.00s - 3955.39s] of what it is that you do. You have to understand the hope that is created by the work that you
[3955.39s - 3964.45s] create. And he told me that don't not to force it that the call would speak to me. And today, the
[3964.45s - 3971.09s] call has spoken to me and I humbly, gratefully and will aggressively respond. And thank you.
[3972.35s - 3974.35s] Wow.
[3978.91s - 3980.19s] You'll have to tell me what he said.
[3982.51s - 3984.67s] That's Willow sitting on the call.
[3984.67s - 3986.67s] Oh, wow.
[3988.77s - 4036.98s] Wow. Goodness. I've forgotten about that. Willow. That's Wild.
[4037.94s - 4042.90s] Wow. I mean, there are so many I could show you. That was one I picked. There were so many.
[4042.90s - 4045.46s] That's fantastic. Beautiful clips of you two together.
[4045.46s - 4057.86s] Yeah. No, that was that was that was one of the, you know, I'm not I'm not a man prone to regrets,
[4057.86s - 4064.74s] you know, and we talked about this a lot. But that was one of the that was one of the regrets.
[4064.74s - 4071.62s] And you know, I'm making my way back around to the ideas and that's, you know, part of our
[4073.62s - 4081.86s] relationship. And rather not swami. But I was sitting with Mr. Mandela. It may have even been
[4081.86s - 4088.96s] that day. And we were sitting was calm. He just had this look on his face. And I said,
[4089.12s - 4096.54s] uh, I said, what's that look on your face? And he was kind of looking, he was just watching people.
[4096.54s - 4099.02s] I said, you know something that the rest of us don't know.
[4101.02s - 4111.90s] He definitely did. He looked at me and he the look that I recognize now was he said, oh,
[4113.22s - 4116.50s] right, that he was like, that's the right question.
[4116.74s - 4125.15s] You know, and he said, um, he said, if you come spend some time with me, I'll teach you.
[4126.50s - 4136.00s] And somehow I was so just felt so unworthy of that. He reached out to me every year
[4137.30s - 4143.22s] before he died. And you know, he said, I'm an old man, you need to come spend some time with me.
[4144.18s - 4155.09s] And I just felt unworthy, you know, and he wanted to teach me what we're studying.
[4158.05s - 4167.81s] You know, he wanted, you know, I, I, I've tasted a little bit of what he wanted to teach me.
[4168.61s - 4178.88s] And the, the, the question is how can you smile in this world? You know, because you're not going
[4178.88s - 4187.22s] to change it. You know, you're going to, you're going to do your part, but this, this, this world
[4187.22s - 4195.46s] is chaotic and it's brutal and it can be really unloving. And how do you do your part with a
[4195.46s - 4203.04s] smile on your face? You know, and it was, um, it was really beautiful. One of the few things,
[4203.04s - 4208.56s] not, not even, you know, I know things happen in their, in their time. So it's not a, not a regret,
[4208.56s - 4211.52s] regret, regret, but it's like a regret.
[4213.60s - 4219.12s] Well, I always say to you that it's, first of all, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's actually a very,
[4219.36s - 4227.74s] um, the fact that you didn't go because you felt unworthy is, is a, at least from the traditions
[4227.74s - 4233.10s] I've studied would be considered extremely good spiritual qualification for learning.
[4233.10s - 4239.10s] Yeah. Like, like when, when we think it's weird, like spiritual life is like, it's teaching you
[4239.10s - 4243.98s] self worth without having low self-esteem. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it's, it's, and you said it
[4243.98s - 4247.90s] once in an interview, speaking about Nelson Mandela, you said, like, you know, it's like being
[4247.98s - 4252.78s] in his presence made you realize how small you were. Yes. Yeah. But how big you could be. How big,
[4252.78s - 4256.86s] yes. Right. You said that. Absolutely. When I heard you say that, I'm gonna start saying that again.
[4256.86s - 4263.26s] Yeah. That's good stuff. Yeah. You said that. You said that. And it was, when I heard you say that,
[4263.26s - 4268.78s] I was like, that is spiritual self worth. Like we live in a world today where self-worth or
[4268.78s - 4273.50s] self-belief is all like, I'm the best. Like I own this. Like I'm worthy of everything. Like,
[4273.50s - 4277.10s] of course Nelson Mandela wants to spend time with Andrew Smith. Like that would,
[4277.10s - 4283.82s] that's material self-worth. Yeah. But it's, it's fickle and it's boring. It's so, it has no base
[4283.82s - 4289.02s] to it. It's baseless. Whereas that feeling of like, when, as you said, that when I'm with him or when
[4289.02s - 4295.10s] I was around him, I realized how small I was, but how big I could be. Yeah. Yeah. That's spiritual
[4295.10s - 4302.38s] self-worth. Yeah. And I think people often confuse humility with weakness or with low self-esteem.
[4302.38s - 4308.38s] Like, well, you must have had low self-esteem, but it's not. It's just the idea that I still
[4308.38s - 4313.50s] have to evolve a little bit to feel like and, and you know, you deserve his time and attention.
[4313.50s - 4319.98s] Yeah. And because you had that, I feel, you know, you've continued in your way to find the,
[4319.98s - 4323.66s] and he's still involved in your life. I think that's the beauty of it. Someone loves you that
[4323.66s - 4327.98s] much. Yeah. They don't stop like your grandmother. She doesn't stop being involved in your life.
[4327.98s - 4333.58s] Absolutely. And I felt every time you've spoken about him, that you've brought him into my life
[4333.58s - 4340.54s] just by speaking about him and now into everyone else's life even more. And, and you know, I'm sure,
[4340.54s - 4345.34s] you know, obviously I can't speak on his behalf at all, but all I can say is that his energy is
[4345.34s - 4349.50s] still in your life for sure. Yeah. That's real. He lives through it. That is real. Yeah. It's,
[4349.50s - 4354.94s] it's beautiful. But I want to talk about a few more things before I let you go. There's, I could
[4354.94s - 4360.70s] talk to you forever and we do do that. So I won't do that today. But I wanted to talk to you about
[4360.70s - 4364.78s] when you mentioned, because this, I have, I came back to this because this was the initial statement
[4364.78s - 4369.50s] that was like, I need to get to know Will. And it was when you said that you were channeling your
[4369.50s - 4378.06s] inner Arjun. Yeah. And you said that and I was just like, what? It's just two of my worlds collided.
[4378.06s - 4383.90s] I grew up watching Freshman's every day. I knew every pickup line. I used every pickup line because
[4383.98s - 4390.54s] of you. I bought the, I bought the bad boys suit. Yeah. You know, for me, it's like, that was my
[4390.54s - 4396.14s] teenage years. Yeah, that's genius. I watched Bad Boys for Life for the seventh time on the way here
[4396.14s - 4401.66s] today to Dubai because I thought I was, I was like, it's, it's offensive to watch any other movie.
[4402.86s - 4408.22s] So I've been a big fan for years. Then I go off, be a monk, I come back and then I'm in the world
[4408.86s - 4414.46s] and then I see you say this and I'm like, what? Like to me, it was just, it was so, it's just,
[4414.46s - 4419.98s] and obviously getting to know you after that has made me go, okay, God had a plan and this is all,
[4419.98s - 4426.62s] you know, but, but tell me about why Arjun as a character for you has been because you even,
[4426.62s - 4431.02s] and I think this is because of you and your storytelling, you even brought Arjun in my life,
[4431.02s - 4436.62s] more to life. So tell me a bit about why Arjun was so synonymous with you and
[4437.10s - 4450.19s] you know, so there are figures in, in spiritual texts and just in general for human beings,
[4450.19s - 4461.14s] you know, being creatures of example, and there's, you know, probably for five or six years before
[4462.10s - 4472.26s] Arjun, I just was stuck on Abraham. I just loved Abraham's life, right? And I was following Abraham
[4472.26s - 4478.98s] and on his, you know, on his death bed, he gets up to wash the feet of the guests in his house,
[4478.98s - 4487.07s] you know, just stories like that, you know, just really stuck with me. So then I started reading
[4487.79s - 4504.37s] about Arjun and the circumstance that he was in for people that don't know Arjun is in a battle,
[4504.37s - 4512.85s] his family has tripped out, he's a wonderful archer, he's the best archer in the world,
[4512.93s - 4519.25s] and his family trips out and take the kingdom and they're like, you know, they snatch his wife
[4519.25s - 4523.81s] and they're trying to disrobe his wife and he's looking like, yeah, what are y'all jokers doing?
[4524.77s - 4533.47s] Like, and he comes home and he's like, and they seize the kingdom and he can't believe that they
[4533.47s - 4541.23s] have done this and he, you know, he's a warrior and, you know, he could get, he could get the kingdom
[4541.23s - 4548.51s] back, you know, but these are his uncles and his brothers-in-laws and his teachers and people
[4548.51s - 4556.91s] that he loved and trusted and they took his kingdom and they prepared an army and they're
[4556.91s - 4565.66s] going to fight Arjuna and he's devastated that his family and his friends and all of that for
[4566.22s - 4575.73s] material gain would would do this to him and he's deeply pious and they prepare an army,
[4575.73s - 4587.34s] the greatest army that's ever been assembled except that they don't know that God is driving Arjuna's
[4587.34s - 4596.74s] chariot, right? And they think they're going to tear through Arjuna, they're going to do all of this,
[4596.74s - 4609.74s] but God is driving Arjuna's chariot, right? And even in that, you know, Arjuna, he's like, how
[4610.90s - 4625.62s] can me killing all of my family be the right answer, right? And on the other side of that,
[4625.62s - 4631.70s] he's like, well, I'll just let them kill me. I'm not doing that. There's no version of me going
[4631.70s - 4637.94s] into battle with them. I don't care how wrong they are. I don't care. And it's, and as I just got
[4637.94s - 4646.05s] deeper and deeper into that story, it's like, I feel like that all the time, right? I feel like I'm
[4646.05s - 4656.91s] in what Radhanath Swamy referred to as a perplexing situation. Always. Always, right? That I feel stuck
[4656.91s - 4670.40s] in a perplexing situation with people I love where there's not clean answers, right? And I always
[4670.40s - 4681.78s] feel strong enough, like if you want to fight, we can fight. I know how to fight, but how can that be
[4681.78s - 4695.74s] the right thing? And I just really related to how the Gita handles those kinds of perplexing
[4695.74s - 4709.02s] situations and recognizing that's what life is. You are born into a perpetual perplexing situation
[4709.98s - 4720.93s] and that it was the first time that I'd ever heard the spiritual idea like that, that life is a
[4720.93s - 4729.49s] perplexing situation and you're never going to get around being stuck in the duality. You have to
[4729.49s - 4743.55s] elevate above the whole thing. And the Christian concept about that, that I always heard and never
[4743.55s - 4747.31s] understood fully, and my grandmother would say all the time, you got to let go and let God.
[4748.51s - 4757.47s] Right? And it was like that. The Gita filled in that concept of what it really means. It doesn't
[4757.47s - 4767.15s] mean don't do anything. Let go and let God doesn't mean don't do anything. It means do your divine
[4767.15s - 4776.66s] duty, whatever that may be. And just for whatever reason, the study of the Gita at this particular
[4776.66s - 4790.77s] point in my life really clarified a lot of ideas of how to move through a world where you almost
[4791.49s - 4806.61s] can't do it right. God's playing a practical joke. And when you start seeing that there's
[4807.25s - 4815.89s] a trick in there, and the Gita illuminated that trick for me in a way, I was like, how could I
[4817.60s - 4826.08s] be the biggest movie star in the world, be the best at all of this, and how you do not love me.
[4826.80s - 4835.44s] Right? And you know, how was my family miserable? And he's like, that's the trick.
[4839.52s - 4845.76s] You know, it's the practical joke. That's beautifully explained because it's the perception
[4845.76s - 4853.36s] of the right reaction. Yes. That's where we get lost is that for us something, going back to what
[4853.36s - 4858.00s] you said at the beginning, you were like, there's no such thing as a bad experience. We're looking
[4858.00s - 4866.72s] at the result of our activity as a signal of how well we're living. Yes, absolutely. And that
[4867.36s - 4873.12s] messes us up because the result of your activities is not under your control. Yes, absolutely. And
[4873.12s - 4877.68s] so if you're living your life based on the result of your activities being a signal that you're
[4877.68s - 4884.40s] successful, you're setting yourself up and all of us do it all the time. I was using
[4887.68s - 4899.12s] Jada's reaction to my actions as a measure of the quality of my actions. And one thing has nothing
[4899.12s - 4912.40s] to do with the other. And that's not what we're taught. And you know, the concept that
[4912.40s - 4923.44s] someone's reaction to your behavior is theirs and your behavior is yours. And when you try to
[4923.44s - 4936.10s] marry the two, when you try to use the outcome as a measure of the quality of your own being,
[4936.66s - 4944.78s] that is the kiss of death. Correct. The way that this material world works, you can do
[4944.78s - 4953.58s] everything right and it still go wrong in terms of outcome. And you can do everything wrong
[4954.54s - 4965.02s] and it still goes right in the outcome. The outcome is not connected to the quality of your
[4965.02s - 4975.90s] behavior. And that is such a hard idea to, you know, to digest. So when I started interacting
[4976.86s - 4986.02s] with Jada and with my family as what a friend of my, Makayla, Makayla, yeah, what she refers to
[4986.02s - 4996.74s] as a freestanding man. Right. So I am certain and I am committed to being who I am and how I want
[4996.74s - 5006.02s] to be without a craving for someone's approval. Right. Because I know their approval doesn't
[5006.02s - 5014.40s] have anything to do with me. Right. And you know, sometimes we get stuck in these situations
[5015.04s - 5027.12s] where we're seeking the approval of someone for our self-esteem. Self-esteem is about yourself.
[5028.24s - 5037.44s] Right. But we start looking to other people for our self-esteem and you know, sometimes we find
[5037.44s - 5046.22s] ourselves looking in broken mirrors to get a reflection of ourselves. Right. And the greatest
[5046.22s - 5053.66s] tragedy is when you look into a broken mirror to see if you're pretty. Right. And you're going to let
[5053.66s - 5062.78s] that person tell you about your inner qualities. And the greatest tragedy is when you look in a
[5062.78s - 5068.94s] broken mirror and you're going to change your face to try to look good in a broken mirror.
[5070.21s - 5074.51s] Man. I'm so glad to be free from that.
[5078.66s - 5086.10s] That was fantastic. That is incredible. And that's it. That's literally it. When you can
[5086.10s - 5093.07s] free yourself from that cycle. Yeah. And it's a trap. It's rough. It's crazy. It just keeps you
[5093.07s - 5103.89s] there. But that's what I think I keep seeing in your journey to see you at this stage in your
[5103.89s - 5110.53s] career to still be growing, still be pushing. I mean, for people who don't know, I have to share
[5110.53s - 5116.29s] this because it's what I find, and this is the only time I get to tell everyone, is for me to see
[5116.37s - 5122.69s] you on set. Busy. Like, you know, I mean, for anyone who's never been on set, it can be a stressful
[5122.69s - 5128.61s] environment. It's high pressure. Like you're acting. You've got to know your lines. You've got to
[5128.61s - 5136.53s] interact. The sun's going down. Will would literally come back in the trailer and he'd be
[5136.53s - 5143.49s] reading in between being on set. So reading spiritual texts, spiritual books in between.
[5143.57s - 5149.81s] And I just saw that I was like, wow, like, you know, it takes so much effort and determination
[5149.81s - 5156.93s] and hunger to be filling each and every gap with growth. And so for anyone who's listening to this
[5156.93s - 5161.25s] podcast while they're driving to work, while they're commuting, while they're editing a video,
[5161.25s - 5165.33s] however you're consuming this podcast, I want you to know, like you're doing that same thing,
[5165.33s - 5169.41s] you're committing to growth, committing to growth in your gaps when you could just be
[5169.41s - 5173.09s] doing something else. Like you could have been in your trailer, I don't know, doing what people
[5173.09s - 5176.61s] do in their trailers. I don't know. I don't know what people do in their trailers. No, that's
[5176.61s - 5182.45s] my past, Jamie. I don't do that in my trailer no more. I'm in there by myself now. All with me.
[5184.45s - 5190.69s] You know, and just I would see that dedication. And I think if, you know, to find time in between
[5190.69s - 5197.81s] when you're filming a movie and it's big budgets and all this, everything and your focus was here.
[5197.89s - 5203.41s] Yeah. Yeah. Your focus was here. Yeah. Even in amongst all of that, that was truly inspirational.
[5203.41s - 5210.21s] And, you know, that behind the scenes look at your internal journey has had such a big impact
[5210.21s - 5217.73s] on my life. It's a no excuses journey. Yeah. It's the only thing to do. Right. So, and that's
[5217.73s - 5228.53s] to learn, right? To, we have to free ourselves from the darkness of our own ignorance. And
[5230.37s - 5236.69s] the, you wouldn't call some something a problem if you understood it. The problem is you don't
[5236.69s - 5243.57s] understand it. That's why you're calling it a problem. Right. You don't, you don't call things
[5244.29s - 5254.13s] problems that you have complete comprehension of. Right. So the process of freeing yourself
[5254.69s - 5262.37s] from the pain and the misery of your difficulties and your problems is in,
[5264.02s - 5274.46s] you know, constantly cultivating a broader comprehension of the deeper absolute truth
[5274.46s - 5283.50s] of what's actually happening. Right. And one of the things that I learned is that if I feel bad,
[5285.68s - 5294.06s] if I'm unhappy, if I'm upset, if I'm disrupted or disturbed, the only thing that could do that
[5294.54s - 5310.02s] is my ignorance. That's the only thing that creates misery is you, you, you slip into a sort of
[5310.58s - 5319.62s] hopelessness of not being able to figure it out. You know, and I just, you know, for me it's, I've
[5320.18s - 5329.68s] gotten to the, to the place that life is school. Right. You know, you're not getting the promotion
[5329.68s - 5337.20s] you want at work. That's school. Get it, figure it out. You know, someone in your family is sick.
[5338.26s - 5345.78s] That's school. That's like life is the greatest teacher there is. You just have to be willing
[5345.78s - 5354.02s] to learn and recognizing that your pain and your suffering is the thing that the universe is poking
[5354.66s - 5362.58s] at. So you recognize that's where you're ignorant. Yeah. You know, you're, you're, you wouldn't be
[5362.58s - 5377.02s] having those struggles in those areas if you had a deep, broad comprehension of the fundamental
[5377.02s - 5384.94s] realities of those situations. Yeah. It's so beautifully said again. It's, I, whereas I was
[5384.94s - 5391.55s] listening to you, I was thinking about how we're programmed to believe that life is for enjoyment.
[5391.55s - 5396.35s] Right. But actually it's for education. It's for education. Yes. Absolutely. And we keep seeking
[5396.35s - 5401.55s] enjoyment in the education. Yes. So we're trying, we think we're in a candy shop, but we're in a
[5401.55s - 5407.95s] classroom. I call that the poisoned honey scenario. Right. Right. You're, you're seeking enjoyment.
[5407.95s - 5413.07s] You want something sweet and you don't recognize that that honey is poisoned. Right. It's going to
[5413.07s - 5418.83s] be sweet going down, but it's, you know, the, the kickback on that thing is something terrible.
[5418.83s - 5426.21s] Yeah. Yeah. And we see that, we see that in, you know, what you're creating now. And I remember
[5426.21s - 5431.49s] we talked about how you're amazing as the genie and you were saying how you felt you got to be
[5431.49s - 5438.05s] so much of you and in the character, but even with the release of a mend that just came out,
[5439.01s - 5443.79s] like, I feel like we've talked about this concept before and you brought it up. You were like,
[5443.79s - 5450.27s] you know, the sacred clown has always been the emblem and the symbol. Yeah. And, and again, it's,
[5450.27s - 5456.03s] it's God's gift where you get to entertain, make people laugh, but you want to help people
[5456.03s - 5462.83s] grow through that. Absolutely. And, and that's really hard to do, but you do, that's you. That's
[5462.83s - 5467.55s] who you are. And tell us about how that's now coming through in the work you're doing. Like,
[5467.55s - 5471.95s] how you've actually brought this into reality because sometimes it can feel very heady.
[5472.35s - 5477.23s] But you've really been working hard on taking it out of the head into the heart and into the world.
[5477.23s - 5480.19s] Yeah. Yeah. And that was that. That was one of the things about
[5482.19s - 5489.39s] Aladdin Aladdin that was so defining for me, you know, and that that concept of the sacred
[5489.39s - 5496.11s] clown. I had written that down in one of my books, you know, five or six years ago. And it's like
[5497.28s - 5509.54s] at my core, that's either who I am or who I want to be, but it's in there. It's in there really
[5509.54s - 5521.54s] deep. And in playing the genie, it was like, I was at home, right? That combination of fun,
[5521.54s - 5533.20s] light, silliness and the imparting wisdom to, to Aladdin, right? I was like, that,
[5534.00s - 5540.24s] that's who I want to be in the world. I want to be singing and dancing and being silly and playing
[5540.24s - 5549.74s] and all of that. And then sneaking the ideas in, you know, under the joy. But I had, I had heard that,
[5549.74s - 5557.18s] I think it was the Lakota Indians or something like that. Native Americans. Yeah. They had the
[5557.18s - 5562.94s] image of the the sacred clown, which is often considered negative. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
[5562.94s - 5569.58s] But it's like I connected to it. It's like, Oh, that's right. That's what that's what the singing
[5569.58s - 5576.38s] and dancing and all of the joy and all of the smiling and all of that is for it's a it's a
[5577.02s - 5588.64s] just a beautiful conduit for the the ideas. And you know, that's just that that's just at my core.
[5588.64s - 5596.56s] That's I'm happiest in that space. Yeah. Beautiful. Well, I could talk to you for hours and we will.
[5596.56s - 5600.80s] And I'm sure we will. I'm going to let you I'm going to ask you what I call the final five.
[5600.80s - 5605.36s] These are one word answers, one word, one word, one sentence, the fast five.
[5605.36s - 5610.00s] Okay, fast five. These are your fast five. The first is what is the best advice you've ever
[5610.00s - 5622.50s] received? The best advice I've ever received. The first day I got on the tour bus when we were
[5622.50s - 5630.21s] leaving for the first time, leaving Philly, me and Jeff and all our squad. And the last thing my
[5630.21s - 5639.49s] grandmother said as the door was closed and she said, she called me lover boy. She she said, she
[5639.49s - 5646.05s] said, Hey, lover boy, remember, be nice to everybody you pass on your way up, because you
[5646.05s - 5655.17s] just might have to pass them again on your way down. And I was like that that that always stuck
[5655.17s - 5659.09s] with me. I love that. That's great. All right. Second question. What's the worst advice you
[5659.09s - 5670.14s] ever received? The worst advice. My boy, Charlie Mack. Charlie Mack told me he said, Hey, man,
[5670.14s - 5674.62s] listen, listen, listen, the way you make a woman love you to make a woman love you, you take out
[5674.62s - 5680.38s] the dinner, you know, and then as you're going out to place, you just knock somebody out because
[5680.38s - 5685.02s] a woman got to know you could defend it. You just knock somebody out. And if you knock, if you knock
[5685.02s - 5689.66s] it, it could be a stranger. And you just you just knock somebody out and she see your strength.
[5689.66s - 5693.42s] And that's how she'll feel confident. And it changes everything. It changes your sexual life.
[5693.42s - 5697.26s] It just changed everything about her. But you got to get them good and just knock somebody out.
[5700.93s - 5703.49s] Did you try it? Yeah, no, I never, never, never tried it.
[5705.49s - 5711.33s] Oh, that's brilliant. I love that. Oh, man. If you, if you were to try it. Yeah, no, I never
[5711.33s - 5716.53s] tried that. Well, I kind of felt that that was bad advice in the moment. Third question. I have to
[5716.61s - 5721.73s] ask you about all three. No, two of them. One thing you learned, learned from observing the
[5721.73s - 5731.81s] life of Julius Irving and Muhammad Ali. Oh, wow. So, so Julius Irving was like the man went right
[5731.81s - 5744.37s] in the heart of my childhood. The 76ers won the championship in 1983 in a four game sweep of the
[5744.37s - 5756.45s] Lakers. It was to have it. And, you know, Dr. J was in everything in Philly. And I would say that
[5756.45s - 5768.66s] the the single thing with Doc is he was he was always dignified. No matter what somebody said,
[5768.66s - 5778.50s] no matter what somebody did, he got in one fight in his entire MBA career. But the idea that he
[5778.50s - 5790.90s] was just perfectly still. And he was an exquisite, well spoken gentleman. And, and that was the thing.
[5791.38s - 5799.14s] He was a killer on the court. But, you know, he was he was he was just
[5799.78s - 5810.02s] exquisitely elegant and peaceful, while at the same time doing the thing. And that balance of
[5810.02s - 5814.98s] those two things I always thought was spectacular. I love that. That's beautiful. Yeah, you said
[5815.62s - 5819.78s] yeah. You guys spent so much time. There's some great interviews between you two.
[5821.06s - 5830.51s] Ali Ali was hilarious. One of the things, you know, so Ali would just come to set,
[5830.51s - 5837.20s] he would walk around, he would walk away and just get on a bus. We say, yeah, where's the champ?
[5837.20s - 5843.44s] And he would get on a bus and just ride a city bus and just ride with people. No idea where the
[5843.44s - 5850.32s] bus is going, nothing, no security, anything like that. Right. And he was engaged with, you know,
[5850.32s - 5859.12s] people in a way I'd never seen anybody like as famous as he was. He engaged with people in that
[5859.12s - 5877.26s] way. And I would say the total and utter submission to God. Right. And he would he looked like he was
[5877.26s - 5885.18s] arrogant. But it was it was the other way. It was like he was talking like that and acting like
[5885.18s - 5897.90s] that because he was so utterly submissive to the will of God. And that combination just really
[5897.90s - 5904.46s] inspired me with how I wanted to be with people in the world. And I asked him, why do you just
[5904.46s - 5910.38s] walk away with people like that? And, you know, you know, he said, oh, man, you got to let these
[5910.38s - 5916.54s] people see you. He said they they never seen nothing like you before. You got you got to get
[5916.54s - 5920.86s] out there and you got to touch them so they know you real. People can't aspire to stuff that they
[5920.86s - 5929.98s] don't think is real. You know, you know, and it was like he was just so in tune with what he was,
[5930.70s - 5940.06s] you know, and he that the the seemingly arrogant humility was was a beautiful combination.
[5940.62s - 5946.22s] I love that. All right. Question number four. What's the biggest lesson you've learned in the
[5946.22s - 5957.26s] last 12 months? In the last 12 months, I would say the it's that ignorance and evil
[5957.26s - 5968.61s] are twins. They look you look at you look at them and they look they look just alike,
[5970.29s - 5980.90s] except that ignorance can be educated. And evil is a much more difficult problem.
[5981.38s - 5994.14s] And I would say I learned, fortunately, that ignorance is much more prevalent than blatant
[5994.14s - 6001.18s] evil. If that's a great answer, that makes a lot. I mean, that makes so much sense.
[6001.18s - 6009.26s] We have to have a whole. That makes a lot of sense. Fifth and final question. If you could create
[6009.26s - 6012.86s] one law in the world that everyone had to follow, what would it be?
[6015.23s - 6027.58s] One law that everyone had to follow. It would be that you have to repeat back
[6028.69s - 6033.41s] what you heard the other person say before you're allowed to say what you think,
[6034.78s - 6043.26s] that the law is you're not allowed to respond to what someone said until you repeat back
[6043.74s - 6048.78s] what you heard and the person has multiple opportunities. No, no, no, that's not I didn't
[6048.78s - 6056.46s] that's not what I meant. And until you repeat back accurately what the person said, you don't get to
[6056.46s - 6065.34s] talk. That is a great law. I love that principle. It helps in every area. Because we our minds go
[6065.34s - 6070.54s] way off the deep end with what we heard somebody say and our response. Well, first of all, we're not
[6070.54s - 6075.34s] really listening because we want to we already know what we want to say no matter what they say.
[6075.90s - 6087.02s] And we go really way off the deep end. I was shocked and surprised by how far we can be
[6087.74s - 6092.30s] from what someone actually said to what we heard. Absolutely.
[6093.74s - 6100.14s] Absolutely. That broken mirror. Yes, exactly. Yeah, I love that. Will, is there anything I haven't
[6100.54s - 6104.30s] let you show something in your heart right now that you like have to say this and you want to
[6104.30s - 6112.30s] share it? It doesn't have to be but not really. In that idea, there was something that popped in
[6112.30s - 6119.74s] when I was saying it. That's called the broken calculator. Right. So and it's about, you know,
[6119.74s - 6129.74s] human interacting and that the the the ego can sometimes be a broken calculator in that imagine
[6129.74s - 6137.01s] the seven is stuck down. So every equation you punch in is seven equals seven equals seven
[6137.01s - 6143.17s] equals seven equals seven. Right. So no matter what you say to a person, if they've experienced
[6143.17s - 6152.72s] a trauma and in their trauma, you know, many shit, many shit. So that's the broken seven.
[6152.72s - 6157.36s] So no matter what you say, no matter how you behave, it keeps coming up many shit.
[6158.00s - 6167.76s] And getting our seven unstuck is a really critical part of being able to interact with
[6167.76s - 6176.93s] other human beings because we're painting on everything we hear them say. We're adding our
[6178.43s - 6185.95s] stuck seven to everything they say and you just can't get the the equation to come out
[6185.95s - 6191.63s] correctly if your calculator is broken. I love that. I've never heard that before. I love that.
[6191.63s - 6196.27s] Yeah. If everyone who goes away listening to this interview, the one thing you remember is that
[6197.07s - 6201.87s] what is that broken calculator? What's that number? You keep adding to the equation and you're
[6201.87s - 6206.19s] going to make it be that no matter what is in front of you, your equation is coming up with
[6206.19s - 6213.23s] your broken number. Yeah. If you want even more videos just like this one, make sure you subscribe
