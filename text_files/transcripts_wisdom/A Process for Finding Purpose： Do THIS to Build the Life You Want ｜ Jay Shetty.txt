[456.84s - 459.60s] And if we actually follow them, we're guaranteed success.
[459.60s - 461.08s] So the first is learn.
[461.08s - 463.20s] The fact that people are listening to us today,
[463.20s - 465.56s] the fact that people follow you, they read your books,
[465.56s - 467.04s] they may listen to mine,
[467.04s - 469.40s] they get the opportunity to learn.
[469.40s - 470.24s] But what's the difference?
[470.24s - 471.80s] We know lots of people that learn,
[471.80s - 473.48s] but never get to change their life.
[473.48s - 474.32s] So what's going wrong?
[474.32s - 475.76s] What's the missing part?
[475.76s - 478.74s] After learning, we have to experiment.
[478.74s - 480.20s] You've got to try this out.
[480.20s - 482.40s] You may try it out tomorrow and it may not work.
[482.40s - 484.64s] You may try it out on Wednesday and it'll work perfectly.
[484.64s - 487.36s] You may try out in a week and then there'll be a little dip.
[487.36s - 489.08s] So experiment with it.
[489.08s - 491.60s] Don't feel like it's going to be perfect tomorrow.
[491.60s - 493.44s] Play with it, have fun with it.
[493.44s - 495.20s] And then the third step is perform.
[495.20s - 498.20s] Once you've experimented, you get into a groove.
[498.20s - 499.76s] You start to feel it working.
[499.76s - 502.04s] You start to notice it in your body.
[502.04s - 504.72s] Your mindset feels different when you wake up in the morning.
[504.72s - 508.08s] Now you don't have to do all the conscious stuff anymore.
[508.08s - 509.60s] It's kind of unconscious.
[509.60s - 511.92s] And then finally, there'll always be struggle
[511.92s - 514.04s] just before you're about to unlock
[514.04s - 515.40s] this new level of greatness.
[515.40s - 517.24s] And then finally, there's thrive.
[517.24s - 519.60s] So to me, that reflection process
[519.60s - 521.72s] is those three steps in between
[521.72s - 525.08s] of experimenting, performing and struggling.
[525.08s - 527.44s] It's the ability to try something out,
[527.44s - 528.80s] then reflect back and go,
[528.80s - 531.96s] wait, how could I have done that 1% different?
[531.96s - 533.72s] How could I have done that 2% different?
[533.72s - 534.92s] What do I need to shift?
[534.92s - 536.96s] And as soon as you start doing that,
[536.96s - 538.48s] you start enjoying reflection.
[538.48s - 540.48s] So reflection is not just in the mind.
[540.48s - 541.60s] It's something you're practicing.
[541.60s - 543.76s] It's something you're experimenting with.
[543.76s - 545.52s] I've never heard anybody explain it that way.
[545.52s - 546.36s] I love that.
[546.36s - 548.40s] Well, it makes so much sense because you're right.
[548.40s - 552.12s] Like I think you can hear an idea and you can try it once.
[552.12s - 554.24s] And then if it doesn't feel the way you want it to feel,
[554.24s - 555.28s] most people stop.
[555.28s - 556.12s] Yes.
[556.12s - 557.56s] And I've never thought about the fact
[557.56s - 561.24s] that if you don't actually know that trying something
[561.24s - 563.28s] and then reflecting on what worked,
[563.28s - 566.60s] what didn't work, tweaking it, experimenting as you said,
[566.60s - 567.64s] you're always going to stop.
[567.64s - 569.16s] Absolutely, absolutely.
[569.16s - 571.16s] And by the way, isn't it just the case, Mel,
[571.16s - 574.40s] that even something that you've done for years,
[574.40s - 576.84s] you still need to keep experimenting with it.
[576.84s - 578.64s] So just because something worked last year
[578.64s - 580.28s] doesn't mean it's going to work this year.
[580.28s - 582.00s] You've got to keep that process going
[582.00s - 584.24s] and that's what makes it fun and alive
[584.24s - 586.64s] and it doesn't become routine and monotonous.
[586.64s - 589.88s] And so I love reflection being in action.
[589.88s - 593.08s] You know, Jay, so many people look to you
[593.08s - 598.08s] because you have written just incredible blockbuster books.
[599.40s - 601.52s] You have millions and millions of followers.
[601.52s - 604.24s] Your podcast is the podcast I listen to.
[604.24s - 607.56s] Your podcast is the podcast that inspired me
[607.56s - 609.32s] to get into the podcasting space.
[609.32s - 610.80s] Mel, you're going to make me cry.
[610.80s - 611.96s] And so, no, I'm serious.
[611.96s - 614.72s] And so I think there are times in your life
[614.72s - 616.56s] and you've certainly felt this way.
[616.56s - 620.80s] Where you're really lost and unhappy and you feel stuck
[620.80s - 622.12s] and I know you've been there.
[622.12s - 623.68s] And so I would love to just,
[623.68s - 626.20s] before we kind of dig into specifics
[626.20s - 629.52s] and unpack some of the lessons from your life,
[629.52s - 631.12s] what would you say to somebody
[631.12s - 633.88s] who really does feel kind of lost right now
[633.88s - 636.44s] or stuck or doesn't know what their next move is?
[636.44s - 639.12s] And how do you want the person who feels that way
[639.12s - 641.68s] to think about that moment
[641.68s - 646.10s] where you feel like you don't know what to do next?
[646.10s - 647.54s] I love what you asked there because you said,
[647.54s - 650.30s] how would you like someone to think about that moment?
[650.30s - 654.53s] What I'd like people to remember is that you're not stuck.
[654.53s - 658.66s] You're actually grieving a past version of yourself.
[658.66s - 661.78s] So there's a part of you that's died
[661.78s - 664.66s] that actually you left behind a long time ago.
[664.66s - 666.98s] But there's a part of you that still misses it.
[666.98s - 668.42s] You still want things to be the same.
[668.42s - 670.30s] You still want things to be that way.
[670.30s - 672.66s] And that keeps pulling you back.
[672.66s - 675.38s] And that's actually blocking you from making the next move.
[675.38s - 678.26s] It's stopping you because life used to be this way
[678.26s - 679.94s] or life used to feel this way.
[679.94s - 683.58s] And so we're stuck not because we don't know what to do next.
[683.58s - 685.54s] We're stuck because there's a part of us
[685.54s - 687.94s] that wants to hold on to what we have here.
[687.94s - 690.50s] There's a beautiful Zen teaching that says,
[690.50s - 694.23s] what's holding you back is what you're holding onto.
[694.23s - 696.55s] And I think if people think about that for a second,
[696.55s - 700.19s] what are you holding onto that's holding you back?
[700.19s - 703.71s] What are you clinging onto that's keeping you stuck?
[703.75s - 706.83s] There's an identity, an idea, a mindset,
[706.83s - 711.19s] a behavior, an attitude that is keeping you held back.
[711.19s - 712.55s] And once you let go of that,
[712.55s - 715.35s] once you open and release your hands,
[715.35s - 717.31s] all of a sudden you feel free.
[717.31s - 719.43s] So what identity, what habit, what mindset,
[719.43s - 724.43s] what expectation are you letting yourself be held back by
[724.47s - 728.58s] that if you were to let go of, you could easily move forward?
[728.58s - 729.78s] Can you give an example?
[729.78s - 730.62s] You know what I'm saying?
[730.62s - 732.98s] Because I think I understand what you're saying.
[733.02s - 735.54s] Like I'm trying to think about a scenario
[735.54s - 740.18s] where let's say somebody is at a moment in their life
[740.18s - 741.54s] where there's a change.
[741.54s - 743.74s] You have gone through a breakup
[743.74s - 746.58s] or maybe you've raised your kids and they've launched
[746.58s - 749.06s] and now you're trying to figure out your next chapter.
[749.06s - 752.30s] Maybe you just lost your job
[752.30s - 754.82s] and now you're like, oh my God, what do I do?
[754.82s - 757.26s] What are the kinds of things that people hold onto
[757.26s - 759.14s] that you may not realize,
[759.14s - 761.18s] this is what you're actually holding onto.
[761.18s - 762.26s] Yes.
[762.26s - 765.34s] So all three examples you gave apply.
[765.34s - 767.94s] If you've raised your kids and they've left the house,
[767.94s - 769.42s] there's a part of you that misses
[769.42s - 771.90s] what the home felt like with their energy.
[771.90s - 774.34s] And now you spend all your day thinking about
[774.34s - 775.70s] all the memories in the corners.
[775.70s - 778.42s] You look in this corner and you remember your child growing up.
[778.42s - 780.78s] You look in this corner and you remember Christmas dinner.
[780.78s - 782.10s] You look at this place.
[782.10s - 784.06s] So you're constantly surrounding yourself
[784.06s - 787.06s] with an identity that no longer exists.
[787.06s - 790.30s] So you don't have the time or the energy or the presence
[790.30s - 792.62s] to be able to even think about what comes next
[792.62s - 795.06s] because there's a part of you that still feels affected.
[795.06s - 797.30s] If you go through a relationship breakup,
[797.30s - 800.42s] you keep looking at pictures of when you went on vacation.
[800.42s - 802.26s] You keep looking at the pictures
[802.26s - 803.98s] of when you had your first date.
[803.98s - 808.82s] You keep looking at the memories of maybe it's a clothing,
[808.82s - 810.62s] piece of clothing, maybe it's an item at home,
[810.62s - 811.82s] whatever you're surrounded by.
[811.82s - 813.62s] So you're still living as if you're still
[813.62s - 816.54s] dating that person in your mind.
[816.54s - 819.62s] And so that's all holding onto something
[819.66s - 822.74s] that is an identity that's already moved on in life.
[822.74s - 824.38s] Your kids have already moved on.
[824.38s - 827.26s] They're at college or they're getting engaged.
[827.26s - 829.78s] Your ex has already moved on.
[829.78s - 832.94s] They're in a new relationship or they're alone.
[832.94s - 836.26s] So reality has moved on, but you've held on
[836.26s - 838.02s] to the piece of clothing, the memory, the photo,
[838.02s - 839.34s] the whatever it may be.
[839.34s - 841.18s] And that's what's keeping you stuck.
[841.18s - 844.46s] So my question to everyone is what is that thing for you
[844.46s - 846.46s] and how do you learn to release it?
[846.46s - 847.34s] That's the focus.
[847.34s - 848.58s] I think we think we're stuck
[848.62s - 850.18s] because we don't know what to do next.
[850.18s - 852.26s] No, we're stuck because we're still holding on
[852.26s - 854.02s] to what's behind us.
[854.02s - 856.90s] And as soon as you release it, you propel yourself forward.
[856.90s - 857.74s] Have you ever felt that before
[857.74s - 859.38s] and you're holding onto something really tight?
[859.38s - 862.02s] If you let go of it, all of a sudden you feel momentum.
[862.02s - 864.38s] Momentum doesn't come from knowing where you're going.
[864.38s - 867.30s] It comes from knowing that I don't wanna be here anymore.
[867.30s - 871.14s] That is so important because so many people
[871.14s - 874.26s] stay where they are because they don't know
[874.26s - 875.18s] where they wanna go next.
[875.18s - 877.30s] And I always say, well, actually,
[877.30s - 879.66s] if you can be honest with yourself and say,
[879.66s - 882.10s] I just don't like how my life feels anymore,
[882.10s - 883.98s] you're already moving in a new direction
[883.98s - 885.62s] because you're moving away from what's not working.
[885.62s - 888.02s] I have one more example to give you
[888.02s - 891.58s] because what you just said was brilliant.
[893.42s - 895.82s] You have this ability, Jay,
[895.82s - 900.85s] to just take wisdom, philosophy, psychology
[901.45s - 904.33s] and make it so immensely obvious
[904.33s - 906.97s] that I both feel inspired and sort of like an idiot
[906.97s - 909.57s] that I didn't see it myself and I'm charged.
[909.57s - 912.05s] But no, I have one more example to give you
[912.05s - 914.53s] about this feeling of being stuck
[914.53s - 917.25s] because there are so many people
[917.25s - 919.93s] that have artistry inside themselves,
[919.93s - 921.85s] whether it's wanting to start a YouTube channel
[921.85s - 924.89s] or it's wanting to become a singer
[924.89s - 929.05s] or it's wanting to express themselves on social media
[929.05s - 931.77s] or it's wanting to learn how to market themselves
[931.77s - 933.13s] better on social media.
[933.33s - 936.61s] And yet there is so much resistance
[936.61s - 938.81s] to putting yourself out there.
[938.81s - 942.09s] And so in this paradigm where we're talking about
[942.09s - 947.09s] holding onto something and grieving who you used to be,
[947.29s - 950.69s] if somebody is actively fighting against
[950.69s - 954.69s] their deep internal desire to start putting themselves
[954.69s - 956.21s] out there in a new chapter,
[956.21s - 957.89s] whether it's marketing a business
[957.89s - 959.25s] or starting a YouTube channel
[959.25s - 962.57s] or performing and singing on whatever it may be,
[962.57s - 964.81s] what is it that you're holding onto?
[964.81s - 967.93s] It's the identity and the reputation
[967.93s - 969.25s] that that identity is built.
[969.25s - 970.33s] Okay, say more about that.
[970.33s - 973.73s] Yes, so it's saying, well, I'm a teacher.
[973.73s - 976.57s] I can't be a social media creator.
[976.57s - 977.41s] I'm a teacher.
[977.41s - 978.85s] That's what my friends know me as.
[978.85s - 980.73s] That's not what my students know me as.
[980.73s - 983.77s] That's what my parents know me as.
[983.77s - 985.17s] That's what my kids know me as.
[985.17s - 988.29s] How can I be a teacher and be a social media creator?
[988.29s - 989.49s] It's not possible.
[989.49s - 990.69s] Oh, I'm a nurse.
[990.69s - 993.49s] How can I be a nurse and a podcaster?
[993.49s - 994.49s] That can't be the case.
[994.49s - 995.57s] What do I have to offer?
[995.57s - 996.81s] I'm a nurse and by the way,
[996.81s - 999.61s] that's what everyone in my social circle knows me as.
[999.61s - 1001.59s] So now if I record a podcast,
[1001.59s - 1003.33s] they're gonna look at me and think,
[1003.33s - 1005.09s] wait, what does she have to say?
[1005.09s - 1007.03s] What are you gonna teach the world?
[1007.03s - 1007.97s] Oh, I'm a mom.
[1007.97s - 1010.41s] I can't be a mom and own a TikTok shop.
[1010.41s - 1011.41s] I don't know how to do that.
[1011.41s - 1013.33s] I didn't go to business school.
[1013.33s - 1014.57s] So this is what we do.
[1014.57s - 1018.41s] And the real reason is because our social circle
[1018.45s - 1023.45s] has validated or at least approved that current position.
[1023.45s - 1026.05s] Everyone in our social circle knows what that means.
[1026.05s - 1028.69s] They recognize it and they understand it.
[1028.69s - 1032.17s] As soon as we do something that people don't understand,
[1032.17s - 1034.77s] we're scared that they're not going to like us.
[1034.77s - 1036.57s] And as soon as we think they're not gonna like us
[1036.57s - 1038.77s] for doing something they don't understand,
[1038.77s - 1041.69s] we leave behind what we love because we say,
[1041.69s - 1044.01s] well, I can't do it if they're gonna misunderstand me.
[1044.01s - 1046.01s] I can't do it if they're gonna dislike me.
[1046.01s - 1047.61s] I have so many friends right now, Mel,
[1047.61s - 1051.40s] honestly that are scared to put out a video
[1051.40s - 1055.04s] because they feel the pressure from their own friends.
[1055.04s - 1056.96s] People are not feeling pressure from the world.
[1056.96s - 1058.72s] People are usually not worried about the comments
[1058.72s - 1061.96s] that will come many years into being a creator.
[1061.96s - 1064.96s] It's the people around us that we're most worried about.
[1064.96s - 1068.64s] And so the only way we let go of that is recognizing
[1068.64s - 1071.04s] and building this identity and insight
[1071.04s - 1073.92s] that I can be a teacher and a creator.
[1073.92s - 1076.44s] I can be a nurse and a podcaster.
[1076.44s - 1079.48s] I can be a mom and own an online business.
[1079.48s - 1081.08s] I can be two things at once
[1081.08s - 1083.48s] and I don't need anyone else's permission.
[1083.48s - 1085.56s] And by the way, when I pull it off,
[1085.56s - 1087.48s] even then they won't understand.
[1087.48s - 1089.24s] So it was never about them understanding.
[1089.24s - 1091.64s] It was always about me focusing on what I love.
[1092.72s - 1095.64s] You know, I know that I've had like so many career changes.
[1095.64s - 1099.00s] I sometimes feel like I'm a cover band for ABBA
[1099.00s - 1100.32s] doing costume changes.
[1100.32s - 1101.48s] Like it's not a resume.
[1101.48s - 1103.44s] It's like a choose your own adventure.
[1103.44s - 1106.72s] But you have had so many twists and turns in your career.
[1106.72s - 1108.76s] You literally went from university
[1108.76s - 1111.08s] to a massive like consulting job
[1111.08s - 1114.80s] to pursuing like spiritual training as a monk
[1114.80s - 1117.00s] to then deciding having an epiphany.
[1117.00s - 1120.28s] And at every one of those moments,
[1120.28s - 1124.44s] there was that pressure that you're talking about
[1124.44s - 1128.32s] where you have to make a call that who you are
[1128.32s - 1131.52s] and how you're living your life no longer feels right.
[1131.52s - 1135.72s] And then you, but you have always made the turn.
[1135.72s - 1138.92s] And so can you just like quickly kind of tell us
[1138.92s - 1141.40s] a few of those moments so that the person listening
[1141.40s - 1144.28s] understands that at any single moment,
[1144.28s - 1147.52s] you are literally one decision away
[1147.52s - 1150.64s] from turning your life in a different direction
[1150.64s - 1154.12s] and talk a little bit about what holds you back
[1154.12s - 1155.76s] when that resistance shows up.
[1155.76s - 1158.28s] Like, well, I can't leave a consulting job.
[1158.28s - 1159.44s] Thank you for saying that.
[1159.44s - 1162.08s] And the idea is everyone needs
[1162.08s - 1164.76s] to become a professional quitter, right?
[1164.76s - 1167.86s] It's like, we need to get really good at quitting.
[1167.86s - 1171.64s] And as I'm listening to you, I'm thinking back to,
[1171.64s - 1175.56s] I remember when I decided to become a monk,
[1175.56s - 1178.42s] pretty much no one around me understood why.
[1178.42s - 1181.72s] I remember when I decided to leave the monastery,
[1181.72s - 1185.35s] pretty much everyone around me didn't understand why.
[1185.35s - 1187.75s] When I decided to get a job in consulting
[1187.75s - 1191.90s] after being a monk, people were like, why?
[1191.90s - 1195.10s] When I decided to leave my successful consulting job
[1195.10s - 1197.50s] to try and make videos online,
[1197.50s - 1199.78s] people were like, why are you doing that?
[1199.78s - 1202.22s] Then when those videos became successful
[1202.22s - 1205.18s] and I decided to launch a podcast,
[1205.18s - 1209.74s] I had three podcast production companies tell me,
[1209.74s - 1211.74s] Jay, people like listening to you for four minutes.
[1211.74s - 1213.58s] No one wants to listen to you for an hour.
[1213.58s - 1215.22s] Don't launch a podcast.
[1215.22s - 1216.90s] So we launched a podcast anyway.
[1216.90s - 1218.90s] And thanks to the millions of people that listen to you,
[1218.90s - 1221.54s] that listen to us, that know us, that became a success.
[1221.54s - 1225.58s] So I always listen to people, not the executives in the room.
[1225.58s - 1227.82s] Then I wanted to launch a book, Mel.
[1227.82s - 1229.34s] And I went to launch a book
[1229.34s - 1232.22s] and 14 out of 17 imprints told me,
[1232.22s - 1234.10s] don't call it think like a monk,
[1234.10s - 1236.50s] because no one wants to think like a monk.
[1236.50s - 1238.38s] Five years later, the books sold millions of copies.
[1238.38s - 1242.84s] Again, thanks to those people, not the people in the room.
[1242.84s - 1244.20s] Why am I sharing all of that?
[1244.20s - 1247.88s] Because I didn't know what the future held.
[1247.88s - 1250.00s] It's not that I had a really clear view
[1250.00s - 1253.16s] of exactly where I was going or that when I left the monastery,
[1253.16s - 1255.96s] I knew I'd be here today or that when we launched a podcast,
[1255.96s - 1256.64s] I knew I'd be here.
[1256.64s - 1258.84s] And I want to get that thought out of people's heads
[1258.84s - 1262.84s] that if I don't have the full life mapped out and planned out,
[1262.84s - 1264.72s] that I can't take the first step.
[1264.72s - 1267.24s] Because I don't think I've ever known where my life's going.
[1267.24s - 1269.92s] And so this whole idea that you have to have everything figured out
[1269.92s - 1273.56s] before you take your first step is the biggest lie we've been told.
[1273.56s - 1275.84s] This idea that if you don't have a clear vision,
[1275.84s - 1277.16s] you don't know where you're going,
[1277.16s - 1278.92s] it's the biggest lie we've been told.
[1278.96s - 1283.16s] How could anyone possibly have every step mapped out?
[1283.16s - 1285.80s] Tell me one person that we know in the world,
[1285.80s - 1287.76s] anyone you look up to that could tell you
[1287.76s - 1290.28s] they meticulously knew every single step.
[1290.28s - 1291.04s] They didn't.
[1291.04s - 1292.52s] But they took that first step.
[1292.52s - 1294.68s] And I think that's what's holding us back is this idea
[1294.68s - 1298.60s] that I have to know everything before I do one thing.
[1298.60s - 1299.64s] What is the one thing, though?
[1299.64s - 1301.80s] Because I think that's the thing that's confounding
[1301.80s - 1305.56s] until you actually figure out the riddle in life, right?
[1305.56s - 1307.52s] It's sort of like you can't explain to somebody
[1307.52s - 1312.00s] what it feels like to be married until you've done it.
[1312.00s - 1312.60s] Yes.
[1312.60s - 1318.88s] You can't explain to somebody how shockingly simple things can be
[1318.88s - 1322.28s] until you've learned how to push through your own resistance
[1322.28s - 1324.36s] to the things that you're interested in
[1324.36s - 1327.16s] and curious about experimenting with or trying.
[1327.16s - 1330.08s] And so for somebody that's never even considered
[1330.08s - 1333.00s] a possibility for themselves beyond consulting
[1333.00s - 1335.32s] or beyond where they're at right now
[1335.36s - 1337.56s] or beyond the major that they had
[1337.56s - 1340.14s] or beyond the city that they live in,
[1340.14s - 1341.66s] what is that first step?
[1341.66s - 1346.06s] And is there a way if you're not even in touch
[1346.06s - 1349.38s] with what it feels like to be pulled towards something new
[1349.38s - 1351.34s] to identify it in yourself?
[1351.34s - 1352.62s] Because I think that's one of the things
[1352.62s - 1353.90s] that you do for people.
[1353.90s - 1357.58s] You help people see a bigger possibility for themselves.
[1357.58s - 1362.74s] And it took me a long time to go from simply surviving
[1362.74s - 1365.70s] and trying to pay bills and get through the day
[1365.70s - 1371.46s] to understanding that there's a different way to wake up
[1371.46s - 1376.26s] and be tapped into the signals and the energetic things
[1376.26s - 1378.74s] that pull you in different directions.
[1378.74s - 1380.66s] Because I think that's what you're talking about
[1380.66s - 1383.90s] when you say all you need to do is take one step.
[1383.90s - 1385.24s] Yes.
[1385.24s - 1388.40s] The step I'd say in the most practical way
[1388.40s - 1390.48s] to make it really, really simple for people
[1390.48s - 1393.72s] and get away from any philosophical idea
[1393.72s - 1397.24s] is it's actually not about falling in love
[1397.24s - 1400.48s] with something new or finding something else.
[1400.48s - 1404.88s] It's about extracting and learning every possible thing
[1404.88s - 1406.32s] from where you are right now.
[1406.32s - 1407.52s] Whatever job you're in.
[1407.52s - 1408.52s] But I don't want to do that, Jay,
[1408.52s - 1409.36s] because I hate my man.
[1409.36s - 1411.52s] But that is the thing, but that is the thing.
[1411.52s - 1413.00s] You can hate where you're at.
[1413.00s - 1413.84s] Yes.
[1413.84s - 1417.68s] And still gain all the skills you need for your future.
[1417.68s - 1418.84s] When I was a consultant,
[1418.84s - 1420.48s] I knew I did not want to be a consultant
[1420.48s - 1421.52s] for the rest of my life.
[1421.52s - 1424.84s] But I learned so many incredible skills from consulting
[1424.84s - 1426.72s] that are so useful today.
[1426.72s - 1429.04s] Whether it's negotiation, whether it's communication,
[1429.04s - 1430.48s] whether it's presentation,
[1430.48s - 1432.24s] whether it's connecting with clients,
[1432.24s - 1434.32s] whatever it may be, there are so many skills.
[1434.32s - 1436.16s] If you're working in a school, I promise you,
[1436.16s - 1439.80s] there are so many skills in that school that are available
[1439.80s - 1440.88s] that if you start learning,
[1440.88s - 1442.96s] all of a sudden that place you hate
[1442.96s - 1444.84s] becomes a place that becomes a stepping stone
[1444.84s - 1445.84s] for your next step.
[1445.84s - 1448.56s] So is there a mindset shift like from,
[1448.56s - 1451.68s] I hate this dread, like there've been times in my life
[1451.68s - 1454.40s] where I literally, you're heading to work,
[1454.40s - 1457.80s] you're just like, I do not want to walk through the door
[1457.80s - 1460.52s] and actually have to be there today.
[1460.52s - 1462.88s] So is there a mindset shift
[1462.88s - 1467.20s] that you would advise us to just hold on to?
[1467.20s - 1468.04s] Yes.
[1468.04s - 1472.34s] Because it shifts the experience of being where you are.
[1472.34s - 1474.04s] What is that mindset shift?
[1474.08s - 1476.76s] If you're going to spend eight to nine hours,
[1476.76s - 1479.72s] maybe more at work every day,
[1479.72s - 1483.04s] it's not great to walk in and think that for nine hours a day,
[1483.04s - 1486.28s] your mind is programming your thoughts to say,
[1486.28s - 1487.60s] I hate being here.
[1487.60s - 1488.68s] I don't want to be here.
[1488.68s - 1489.96s] I can't wait to get out
[1489.96s - 1492.72s] because you've wasted nine hours of your day
[1492.72s - 1494.88s] that could be used in building the next thing.
[1494.88s - 1498.16s] So the mindset shift is, I do hate being here.
[1498.16s - 1499.20s] I'm going to accept that.
[1499.20s - 1500.24s] I'm going to acknowledge that.
[1500.24s - 1502.04s] I'm not going to lie to myself,
[1502.04s - 1505.50s] but I'm going to take everything I possibly can
[1505.50s - 1509.88s] from this opportunity because it is a part of my story.
[1509.88s - 1512.32s] And it is such a powerful part of my story
[1512.32s - 1514.48s] because this only makes the story better.
[1514.48s - 1516.72s] I'm going to learn from a place that I hate
[1516.72s - 1519.92s] and I'm going to learn everything I possibly can.
[1519.92s - 1521.64s] And so that mindset shift is,
[1521.64s - 1526.36s] how do I turn and transform a place of misery and pain
[1526.36s - 1529.04s] and potentially suffering into a place
[1529.04s - 1531.00s] that becomes the launchpad of my life?
[1531.12s - 1532.96s] And all of a sudden, now you're walking into work
[1532.96s - 1535.52s] thinking, oh, this is a launchpad.
[1535.52s - 1537.04s] Oh, wait a minute, this is a step.
[1537.04s - 1539.92s] This is the place where I take off from
[1539.92s - 1543.36s] rather than, oh, this is a place that's keeping me in prison.
[1543.36s - 1545.76s] And I think that's the switch that people need to make
[1545.76s - 1548.80s] because if you're always looking for it outside of work,
[1548.80s - 1550.92s] you're only giving yourself two hours in the evening,
[1550.92s - 1552.20s] maybe an hour if you're lucky
[1552.20s - 1554.40s] after you've done the chores, put the kids to bed,
[1554.40s - 1555.72s] washed the dishes.
[1555.72s - 1558.64s] So why not use those eight to nine hours to build skills,
[1558.64s - 1559.48s] to build confidence,
[1559.48s - 1562.20s] to build security that you have available to you?
[1562.20s - 1563.76s] Well, you know what else I hear?
[1563.76s - 1564.60s] I hear trust.
[1564.60s - 1565.44s] Yes.
[1565.44s - 1566.60s] Because I think a lot of times,
[1566.60s - 1570.56s] at least me personally, when I felt very stuck,
[1570.56s - 1572.84s] there was this intense feeling,
[1572.84s - 1574.56s] like I was in the wrong place,
[1574.56s - 1576.52s] which then creates resistance.
[1576.52s - 1580.48s] And what you just did is by saying,
[1580.48s - 1582.24s] if I'm going to spend eight hours here,
[1582.24s - 1583.76s] then I'm going to get everything I can out of it
[1583.76s - 1587.24s] because I trust that by doing that,
[1587.28s - 1589.96s] I'll actually find the next thing.
[1589.96s - 1592.56s] There's a beautiful book which talks about
[1592.56s - 1597.12s] how really we find our purpose through sampling.
[1597.12s - 1598.48s] And when I think of the word sampling,
[1598.48s - 1603.16s] the way I describe it as is collecting and connecting.
[1603.16s - 1606.96s] You are collecting stories, experiences,
[1606.96s - 1611.68s] skills and ideas in every job you work in.
[1611.68s - 1615.72s] And one day after collecting for many, many years,
[1615.72s - 1620.12s] you will connect the dots of all of those different skills,
[1620.12s - 1622.44s] of all of those different experiences.
[1622.44s - 1624.68s] And that's when everything falls into place.
[1624.68s - 1626.76s] But if you don't collect in the first place,
[1626.76s - 1628.24s] there's nothing to connect.
[1628.24s - 1630.76s] It's not about finding and discovering something.
[1630.76s - 1632.32s] It's collecting along the way.
[1632.32s - 1634.08s] You're collecting little jigsaw pieces.
[1634.08s - 1636.24s] And then one day you spread them out and you put them down
[1636.24s - 1638.36s] and you start putting the pieces out and they all fit.
[1638.36s - 1640.72s] And you go, oh my gosh, I can't believe they connected.
[1640.72s - 1642.40s] When I look back in my life and I think,
[1642.40s - 1645.36s] I'm as much a consultant as I am a monk,
[1645.36s - 1647.20s] as I am a media person,
[1647.20s - 1649.40s] all of those things are really valuable parts of me.
[1649.40s - 1651.40s] And it goes back to the point I was making earlier.
[1651.40s - 1653.44s] I can't be a nurse and a content creator.
[1653.44s - 1654.72s] I can't be this and that.
[1654.72s - 1657.52s] Well, you can because that is your superpower.
[1657.52s - 1660.36s] Your superpower is that you did what you did in the past
[1660.36s - 1661.20s] and what you do now.
[1661.20s - 1662.76s] And by the way, you already are those things.
[1662.76s - 1664.64s] You already are those things, whether you like it or not.
[1664.64s - 1668.59s] And maybe that's the whole point
[1668.59s - 1670.27s] that you already are those things,
[1670.27s - 1672.15s] which is why you feel haunted
[1672.15s - 1675.23s] when you are in a chapter in your life
[1675.23s - 1678.99s] that is over and it's time for you to move toward
[1678.99s - 1680.95s] the next thing that's already a part of you.
[1680.95s - 1682.91s] And the reason why you know it's already a part of you
[1682.91s - 1684.71s] is because you actually feel pulled
[1684.71s - 1687.99s] to make YouTube videos or pulled to go back to graduate school
[1687.99s - 1691.43s] or pulled to be in a different relationship.
[1691.43s - 1694.67s] And I think this all goes back to college and school
[1694.67s - 1696.87s] in the sense that we were all forced to think
[1696.87s - 1698.51s] you had to pick one thing.
[1698.51s - 1700.39s] Your whole life, you were trained to say,
[1700.39s - 1702.55s] I've got to pick one thing that I've got to do
[1702.55s - 1703.79s] for the rest of my life.
[1703.79s - 1705.15s] That's how you were trained.
[1705.15s - 1706.07s] So when you were young,
[1706.07s - 1707.79s] you start narrowing down your subjects,
[1707.79s - 1709.59s] you get a college, you pick a major,
[1709.59s - 1710.79s] you focus in on one thing
[1710.79s - 1712.71s] and you think you have to do that for the rest of your life.
[1712.71s - 1714.43s] And then you start doing it for three years
[1714.43s - 1716.19s] and then three years into a new job,
[1716.19s - 1718.55s] you go, I don't wanna do this anymore.
[1718.55s - 1719.99s] This isn't what it was meant to be.
[1719.99s - 1721.11s] But your whole life, you were told
[1721.11s - 1722.91s] you could only be one thing.
[1722.91s - 1725.03s] You had to pick one thing to focus on.
[1725.03s - 1727.19s] So that's why we're so obsessed with this idea
[1727.19s - 1730.11s] that my title should have to be one thing.
[1730.11s - 1731.19s] I should be able to say I'm a lawyer,
[1731.19s - 1732.99s] I'm an accountant, I'm a doctor, I'm a nurse,
[1733.03s - 1735.47s] I'm a teacher, I'm a mom, whatever it is.
[1735.47s - 1738.19s] But I can't be at three things, that's complicated.
[1738.19s - 1739.79s] But we've been forced to believe
[1739.79s - 1741.27s] that you are that title.
[1741.27s - 1743.15s] You are a manager, or by the way,
[1743.15s - 1745.55s] senior manager and you feel better about it,
[1745.55s - 1748.07s] or executive and you made it to feel better about it,
[1748.07s - 1749.55s] but you're only allowed to be that.
[1749.55s - 1751.15s] You can't then be anything else.
[1751.15s - 1753.71s] And so I love it when I see people in their Instagram buyers
[1753.71s - 1755.59s] and people are like, I'm a mom first,
[1755.59s - 1757.47s] but I'm an executive second, I'm a this.
[1757.47s - 1759.51s] I love it that people are playing with that idea
[1759.51s - 1761.55s] because that's the permission we need.
[1762.47s - 1767.47s] So Jay, what is the difference between purpose and passion?
[1767.87s - 1770.51s] And what do we get wrong about it?
[1770.51s - 1772.91s] Passion is what brings you life.
[1772.91s - 1774.31s] It's what brings you joy.
[1774.31s - 1778.87s] It's what makes you feel like you're doing something exciting
[1778.87s - 1780.43s] and exhilarating and thrilling.
[1780.43s - 1783.63s] So for me, it's studying and learning and synthesizing.
[1783.63s - 1786.83s] I could spend a weekend in a cave of books
[1786.83s - 1789.19s] and never get out and make notes and study.
[1789.19s - 1792.17s] That's one of my greatest passions in life.
[1792.17s - 1795.41s] Your purpose is when you use your passion
[1795.41s - 1797.25s] in the service of others.
[1797.25s - 1800.61s] If your passion doesn't have a service element,
[1800.61s - 1803.29s] if you don't use it to improve people's lives,
[1803.29s - 1805.53s] if you don't use it to inform other people,
[1805.53s - 1808.41s] if you don't use it to make a difference in someone's life,
[1808.41s - 1809.93s] it's not a purpose.
[1809.93s - 1811.33s] So let me give an example.
[1811.33s - 1813.13s] If you're a photographer
[1813.13s - 1815.65s] and your favorite passion in the world is photography,
[1815.65s - 1817.77s] you love finding unique locations,
[1817.77s - 1819.81s] you love capturing human emotion,
[1819.85s - 1822.29s] you love capturing memories for people.
[1822.29s - 1825.17s] As soon as you start doing it for others, it's a purpose.
[1825.17s - 1826.85s] There you have it. It's that simple.
[1826.85s - 1829.49s] It's not like you have to go on a whole charity trail
[1829.49s - 1831.73s] and start taking pictures and giving them out for free.
[1831.73s - 1833.13s] When you start capturing moments
[1833.13s - 1836.09s] and you do it with that intent, it's a service.
[1836.09s - 1837.73s] There's a beautiful study that I love
[1837.73s - 1839.97s] from Amy Vrasniewski and their team
[1839.97s - 1841.93s] at the Yale School of Management.
[1841.93s - 1846.93s] So they went out in 2019 to research what they believed
[1846.93s - 1849.97s] was the most difficult job in America.
[1849.97s - 1851.05s] Any guesses, Mel?
[1853.35s - 1855.55s] Psychologically or physically.
[1855.55s - 1857.59s] Well, they just went out to think
[1857.59s - 1858.63s] what was the most difficult job.
[1858.63s - 1859.71s] Well, I think probably teacher.
[1859.71s - 1861.23s] Yeah, that was up there.
[1861.23s - 1862.59s] Or public servant, I don't know.
[1862.59s - 1863.43s] All up there.
[1863.43s - 1866.79s] The one that they decided on was hospital cleaner,
[1866.79s - 1868.23s] because they believed that these people
[1868.23s - 1871.71s] not only have to wash bedsheets, pillows, floors,
[1871.71s - 1875.83s] toilets, plates, they have to wash up after people pass away.
[1875.83s - 1876.91s] So it was a very heavy job.
[1876.91s - 1879.15s] And also you just finished cleaning a toilet,
[1879.15s - 1881.55s] you leave and now you got to run in and clean it again.
[1881.55s - 1883.91s] It's not as simple as, hey, we did that once
[1883.91s - 1885.35s] and it doesn't happen anymore.
[1885.35s - 1887.99s] So they went and interviewed these hospital cleaners
[1887.99s - 1889.67s] and they asked them what they did.
[1889.67s - 1891.55s] And the hospital cleaners said,
[1891.55s - 1894.63s] we believe we're low skilled labor in their own words.
[1894.63s - 1896.83s] We wash toilets, plates, floors.
[1896.83s - 1899.55s] They carried on and they found this whole group
[1899.55s - 1903.19s] of hospital cleaners who didn't call themselves cleaners.
[1903.19s - 1907.11s] They call themselves healers and carers.
[1907.11s - 1911.83s] These healers worked the exact same hours as the cleaners.
[1911.83s - 1914.27s] They worked the same shifts.
[1914.27s - 1915.99s] They worked the same hospitals.
[1915.99s - 1917.67s] They got paid the same amount,
[1917.67s - 1919.47s] but they were happier, more purposeful
[1919.47s - 1920.99s] and more productive.
[1920.99s - 1923.99s] So they asked them, why do you call yourself healers?
[1923.99s - 1925.75s] They said, and this blew my mind,
[1925.75s - 1927.91s] like every time I think about this,
[1927.91s - 1931.23s] it really makes me emotional because it's so powerful.
[1931.23s - 1935.89s] They said, we believe that a clean hospital
[1935.89s - 1939.81s] is integral to the healing journey of a patient.
[1939.81s - 1942.53s] We think that when the hospital is clean,
[1942.53s - 1946.57s] people have more dignity at a time of difficulty.
[1946.57s - 1949.66s] We believe that when the hospital is clean,
[1949.66s - 1953.46s] that people's families will spend more time with them.
[1953.46s - 1955.70s] They'll actually surround their bedside
[1955.70s - 1957.78s] because it feels like a clean atmosphere
[1957.78s - 1959.88s] in their time of need.
[1959.88s - 1962.96s] They said, we believe that a clean hospital
[1962.96s - 1964.64s] is part of healing.
[1964.64s - 1967.90s] So how could we see ourselves as anything else?
[1967.90s - 1969.62s] What I love about that, Mel,
[1969.62s - 1971.70s] is that Amy Verzniewski and her team
[1971.70s - 1974.34s] came up with the term called job crafting,
[1974.34s - 1978.66s] which means it's not what you do every day.
[1978.66s - 1981.54s] It's how you feel about what you do every day
[1981.54s - 1983.50s] that changes the experience of it.
[1983.50s - 1984.70s] It's not just what you do.
[1984.70s - 1986.02s] It's not even why you do it.
[1986.02s - 1988.10s] It's how you feel about it.
[1988.10s - 1990.22s] How do you feel about what you do?
[1990.22s - 1993.94s] They all felt that what they did was critical to healing
[1993.94s - 1996.06s] and it transformed their experience.
[1996.06s - 1997.94s] And there's this beautiful quote from Wayne Dyer
[1997.94s - 2000.10s] that I loved where he said,
[2000.10s - 2002.70s] when you change the way you look at things,
[2002.70s - 2005.26s] the things you look at change.
[2005.26s - 2007.94s] And I really believe that that's what we're all being called
[2007.94s - 2008.98s] to do right now.
[2008.98s - 2010.50s] When you're feeling stuck,
[2010.50s - 2012.90s] you might not be able to change what's around you.
[2012.90s - 2014.66s] So change how you view it.
[2014.66s - 2016.18s] Change how you look at it
[2016.18s - 2018.58s] because all of a sudden everything starts to change
[2018.58s - 2019.98s] in your favor.
[2019.98s - 2022.30s] That is the single best definition
[2022.30s - 2024.08s] of purpose I've ever heard.
[2024.08s - 2026.08s] And it's accessible.
[2026.08s - 2028.76s] And I wanna make sure that as you're listening to Jay
[2028.76s - 2030.44s] and you're spending time together with us
[2030.44s - 2033.68s] that you really take away that definition.
[2033.68s - 2035.48s] Because it's even when you're stuck
[2035.48s - 2038.44s] or even when you've just got a lot going on,
[2038.44s - 2041.60s] it's very easy to identify the little things
[2041.60s - 2043.60s] in your life that energize you.
[2043.60s - 2046.20s] Whether it's books like Jay or for me,
[2046.20s - 2049.28s] I love gardening and flowers and I love cooking.
[2049.28s - 2051.56s] I love spending time with my family.
[2051.56s - 2053.16s] I love making people smile.
[2053.16s - 2054.80s] That brings me energy, right?
[2054.80s - 2055.84s] I love being outside.
[2055.84s - 2057.28s] I love learning.
[2057.28s - 2060.24s] And so when you take those things
[2060.24s - 2062.08s] that naturally bring you energy
[2062.08s - 2064.76s] and you do a little bit more of it, it lifts you up.
[2064.76s - 2066.92s] But then when you figure out ways
[2066.92s - 2070.36s] to extend those things that bring you energy
[2070.36s - 2073.00s] in service of others,
[2073.00s - 2075.92s] now you're on the track of discovering
[2075.92s - 2078.12s] why you're here in the first place
[2078.16s - 2079.84s] and aligning your life with purpose.
[2079.84s - 2083.35s] And so in that beautiful example you just gave
[2083.35s - 2086.27s] and thinking about it energizes people
[2086.27s - 2090.83s] to be part of something where you're caring for people.
[2090.83s - 2092.23s] Even in the hardest job in the world,
[2092.23s - 2093.83s] that's why I use that example.
[2093.83s - 2096.39s] Because those individuals may not even be passionate
[2096.39s - 2098.03s] about cleaning,
[2098.03s - 2100.55s] but they've found a way to think about it differently.
[2100.55s - 2102.39s] That's why it touches my heart so much.
[2102.39s - 2105.55s] Because it's in such a difficult space and environment.
[2105.55s - 2107.35s] And to your point, Mel, what you were just saying,
[2107.39s - 2111.39s] I was talking to one of my team about this.
[2111.39s - 2114.31s] And she was talking to me about how her mom
[2114.31s - 2116.59s] didn't really know what her purpose was.
[2116.59s - 2118.27s] So I asked her, what's her passion?
[2118.27s - 2120.11s] And she said her favorite thing
[2120.11s - 2122.83s] is to organize family trips.
[2122.83s - 2126.75s] And so now her mom has started organizing family trips
[2126.75s - 2128.59s] for not only her family,
[2128.59s - 2130.83s] but the friends of her family and couples.
[2130.83s - 2134.23s] And so she's a retired mom at this point in her life,
[2134.23s - 2135.87s] but she loves planning trips.
[2135.87s - 2138.59s] She lives vicariously through all of her kids
[2138.59s - 2141.07s] and their friends and grandkids and whoever else it is.
[2141.07s - 2142.35s] And that's what she does now.
[2142.35s - 2143.63s] That's a purpose.
[2143.63s - 2145.91s] Your purpose doesn't need to be this big thing
[2145.91s - 2148.51s] that you have to go and change a million people's lives
[2148.51s - 2149.43s] or a billion people's lives.
[2149.43s - 2151.19s] If you can do that, that's beautiful.
[2151.19s - 2152.35s] But that's not what a purpose is.
[2152.35s - 2155.27s] A purpose is not defined by scale.
[2155.27s - 2158.23s] It's not defined by the amount of people you reach.
[2158.23s - 2160.35s] It's not defined by doing something big.
[2160.35s - 2162.47s] Your purpose doesn't have to be your job.
[2162.47s - 2165.27s] It doesn't have to be something you dream of doing every day.
[2165.27s - 2167.83s] Your purpose is simply using your passion
[2167.83s - 2170.47s] in the service of others in the smallest of ways,
[2170.47s - 2172.11s] in the simplest of ways.
[2172.11s - 2173.67s] And it brings you so much joy.
[2173.67s - 2177.43s] And by the way, it also gives you validation
[2177.43s - 2179.07s] for something beautiful that you do.
[2179.07s - 2180.31s] We all want validation.
[2180.31s - 2181.55s] We all seek it.
[2181.55s - 2182.99s] And I want to just normalize that
[2182.99s - 2185.75s] because I think people feel bad for wanting it.
[2185.75s - 2188.83s] But we all need to feel wanted and needed and loved.
[2188.83s - 2190.59s] It's part of being human.
[2190.59s - 2193.39s] But the problem is when you become someone
[2193.43s - 2195.07s] you don't want to be or do something
[2195.07s - 2197.39s] you don't want to do to get validation.
[2197.39s - 2198.59s] Whereas when you get validated
[2198.59s - 2201.19s] for using your passion in the service of others,
[2201.19s - 2203.39s] there's no greater feeling than that.
[2203.39s - 2204.59s] You know, I want to give an example
[2204.59s - 2206.99s] because I feel like one of the mistakes
[2206.99s - 2208.47s] that I made for a long time
[2208.47s - 2211.35s] when it came to, quote, discovering my purpose
[2211.35s - 2213.66s] is that I thought it was one thing.
[2213.66s - 2217.10s] And it's actually everything.
[2217.10s - 2217.94s] Yes.
[2217.94s - 2219.74s] And so when we moved to Southern Vermont
[2219.74s - 2221.62s] and I remember feeling very stuck
[2221.62s - 2223.86s] and in a new chapter and isolated
[2223.86s - 2226.66s] and needing to meet all new friends
[2226.66s - 2228.14s] and build community,
[2228.14s - 2232.22s] that I learned of this flower farmer.
[2232.22s - 2234.54s] And her flowers were,
[2234.54s - 2237.38s] it was near the end of the summer and into fall
[2237.38s - 2239.30s] and frost was coming and it's dahlias.
[2239.30s - 2240.90s] And you need to dig them up.
[2240.90s - 2243.30s] And I'm getting really geeky on flowers.
[2243.30s - 2245.38s] And the frost was starting to hit.
[2245.38s - 2247.26s] And it was an entire field.
[2247.26s - 2248.38s] And they were all going to die.
[2248.38s - 2249.86s] And I felt this like ache
[2249.86s - 2252.82s] because flowers bring me energy.
[2254.34s - 2256.78s] I tracked down the person
[2256.78s - 2258.70s] who was growing the flowers
[2258.70s - 2262.06s] and found out that they had had a health issue.
[2262.06s - 2264.18s] And so I organized a bunch of women
[2264.18s - 2266.10s] that I had recently met
[2266.10s - 2270.22s] to help this person dig up the tubers.
[2270.22s - 2274.30s] That is an example that has nothing to do with career.
[2274.30s - 2277.50s] It has nothing to do with my life's mission
[2277.50s - 2279.66s] and all the things I do for work.
[2279.66s - 2282.30s] It is a small example
[2282.30s - 2286.26s] of how I took something that energized me
[2286.26s - 2290.94s] and use that energy that's authentic to me
[2290.94s - 2293.42s] in service of someone else.
[2293.42s - 2296.98s] And that small example
[2296.98s - 2301.14s] is an example of how you can infuse a sense of purpose
[2301.14s - 2302.90s] in your day-to-day life
[2302.90s - 2306.90s] in really small but deeply meaningful and important ways.
[2306.90s - 2308.74s] Yes, yes, I love that.
[2308.74s - 2310.10s] And it's so true.
[2310.10s - 2310.98s] I'm thinking about Radhi.
[2310.98s - 2313.38s] When Radhi first moved with me to America,
[2313.38s - 2315.58s] she couldn't work here because she was on a spouse visa
[2315.58s - 2317.90s] and until we all got all that sorted out.
[2317.90s - 2321.42s] And Radhi wasn't always the writer
[2321.42s - 2322.86s] of a New York Times best-selling cookbook.
[2322.86s - 2326.78s] Like that's a very recent iteration of her life.
[2326.78s - 2328.34s] Well, when we became friends, Jay,
[2328.34s - 2332.34s] so like you and I have been friends for a long time
[2332.34s - 2335.06s] and we are extremely supportive
[2335.06s - 2336.34s] and fond of one another.
[2336.34s - 2338.02s] Our spouses know each other.
[2338.02s - 2339.70s] But when I first met you and Radhi,
[2339.70s - 2342.98s] she had not launched this part of her life.
[2342.98s - 2345.54s] Absolutely, no social media, no content.
[2345.54s - 2346.62s] Yeah, exactly.
[2346.62s - 2348.78s] And so obviously we remember her like that.
[2348.78s - 2350.18s] She isn't like that to the world now,
[2350.18s - 2353.70s] but I remember when we moved to LA,
[2353.70s - 2355.74s] Radhi would just be really sad
[2355.74s - 2358.94s] when we'd be driving around and see the homeless situation.
[2358.94s - 2360.98s] And she always loved cooking.
[2360.98s - 2362.26s] Like she was always a fan of cooking.
[2362.26s - 2364.62s] Since I've known her, she's been an amazing cook.
[2364.62s - 2366.54s] She would literally just cook and deliver meals.
[2366.54s - 2368.46s] She'd get involved in food distribution programs
[2368.46s - 2369.34s] in the area.
[2369.34s - 2371.10s] She'd go and find out and talk to communities
[2371.10s - 2372.54s] of how she could help.
[2372.54s - 2374.30s] Before she made any content,
[2374.30s - 2376.30s] she was just out there doing that.
[2376.30s - 2378.66s] And that's what built her confidence
[2378.66s - 2380.54s] in being able to do it and being able to deliver.
[2380.54s - 2382.06s] And then even when someone said to her,
[2382.06s - 2383.06s] hey, would you cater?
[2383.06s - 2385.54s] She said, I don't wanna do it as catering.
[2385.54s - 2388.74s] She loves cooking as an act of love, as an act of service.
[2388.74s - 2390.78s] If you come over, she'd wanna cook for you
[2390.78s - 2391.62s] because you're a friend.
[2391.62s - 2392.86s] That's what she enjoys.
[2392.86s - 2394.34s] She wants to cook for people in need.
[2394.34s - 2396.66s] That's what she gets passion from.
[2396.66s - 2397.86s] She doesn't actually wanna be said,
[2397.86s - 2399.98s] hey, can you make 20 meals of this?
[2399.98s - 2402.26s] That's not actually what brings her joy.
[2402.26s - 2404.98s] And so you can see how your purpose
[2404.98s - 2406.62s] doesn't have to be your job.
[2406.62s - 2408.62s] Your purpose doesn't have to be big.
[2408.62s - 2410.94s] Your purpose doesn't have to get you followers.
[2410.94s - 2413.42s] Your purpose doesn't need to have social media.
[2413.42s - 2415.26s] It doesn't need to have any of those things.
[2415.26s - 2417.94s] And actually, if you start without all of those things,
[2417.94s - 2421.18s] you'll build more confidence, more self-worth,
[2421.18s - 2424.26s] and more joy that then if you wanna do any of those things,
[2424.26s - 2425.62s] they'll happen naturally.
[2425.62s - 2427.38s] They'll come as a byproduct
[2427.38s - 2429.82s] of that infectious energy you feel
[2429.82s - 2431.06s] and that I've seen rather you feel.
[2431.06s - 2434.34s] Well, I wanna come back to two themes and highlight it.
[2434.34s - 2435.46s] You know, one of the things that you said
[2435.46s - 2439.18s] is it's not about imagining the thing out there.
[2439.18s - 2442.30s] It's about really stopping and listening
[2442.30s - 2445.86s] and reflecting on what Jay is sharing with you
[2445.86s - 2447.90s] about the fact that there's something
[2447.90s - 2450.18s] that's already bringing you energy,
[2450.18s - 2454.90s] that when you do it, it just brings something out in you
[2454.90s - 2457.54s] and then finding ways to do it in service of others.
[2457.54s - 2460.18s] So if you take the example of your wife,
[2460.18s - 2463.90s] she's focused on cooking as an act of love.
[2463.90s - 2465.58s] It's always been a creative expression.
[2465.58s - 2468.06s] It naturally energizes her.
[2468.06s - 2471.26s] And so she used that to lift herself up
[2471.26s - 2472.46s] in a new chapter of her life.
[2472.46s - 2475.78s] She found a way to be of service.
[2475.78s - 2479.58s] And the amazing thing about life
[2479.62s - 2481.42s] is that when you align yourself
[2481.42s - 2483.98s] with the things that naturally energize you
[2483.98s - 2485.82s] and you, let's come to a second thing
[2485.82s - 2489.82s] we've talked about, Jay, trust that where you are
[2489.82s - 2495.54s] is somehow in service of where you're meant to go.
[2495.54s - 2499.94s] Follow the energy and follow how you serve others
[2499.94s - 2501.90s] in sharing that energy.
[2501.90s - 2506.74s] And that is how you actually start walking in the path
[2506.74s - 2507.88s] that is meant for you.
[2507.88s - 2510.18s] And I just wanna point out
[2510.22s - 2512.74s] that not only is she a New York Times
[2512.74s - 2514.86s] best-selling cookbook author,
[2514.86s - 2519.22s] but the name of the cookbook is Joy Full
[2519.22s - 2523.02s] as an F-U-L-L because you're full
[2523.02s - 2525.18s] of her fabulous vegan cooking.
[2525.18s - 2530.18s] And so she didn't start cooking and serving people in LA
[2531.04s - 2531.88s] because she's like,
[2531.88s - 2533.50s] I'm gonna write a cookbook one of these days.
[2533.50s - 2534.34s] Exactly.
[2534.34s - 2539.20s] She did it to lift herself up at a moment in her life
[2539.24s - 2540.64s] where she was stuck
[2540.64s - 2542.64s] and where she was moving to a new place.
[2542.64s - 2545.68s] And so it's so important to understand
[2545.68s - 2548.20s] it's not the thing that you're imagining.
[2548.20s - 2549.68s] It's the energy in you
[2549.68s - 2552.24s] and it's the ability to shift your mindset
[2552.24s - 2554.88s] and trust that if you leverage that positive energy
[2554.88s - 2556.20s] in service of others,
[2556.20s - 2561.00s] it always, always, always points you where you're meant to go.
[2561.00s - 2561.84s] Yes.
[2561.84s - 2563.68s] And people will say to us,
[2563.68s - 2565.68s] but I don't know what I like.
[2565.68s - 2567.06s] I don't know what gives me energy.
[2567.06s - 2568.28s] I hear that a lot today.
[2568.28s - 2569.12s] You do.
[2569.12s - 2570.64s] But it's like people are just like,
[2570.64s - 2572.93s] I don't know what gives me energy anymore.
[2572.93s - 2573.77s] I'm kind of numb to it.
[2573.77s - 2576.45s] Like, and I think the point is not to find this
[2576.45s - 2579.43s] big, bright light of energy from something.
[2579.43s - 2581.53s] It's this small, tiny voice.
[2581.53s - 2583.93s] It's been ignored for so long
[2583.93s - 2586.09s] that the way it shows up within us
[2586.09s - 2589.21s] isn't always this big loud scream.
[2589.21s - 2591.69s] It's this quiet little whisper that just says,
[2591.69s - 2593.61s] try this, give it a go.
[2593.61s - 2595.01s] It's not this big calling.
[2595.01s - 2597.01s] I think we think about callings
[2597.01s - 2599.57s] and what we want to do is this big,
[2599.57s - 2602.17s] bright light of information and a sign.
[2602.17s - 2604.13s] Signs are small.
[2604.13s - 2606.69s] They're whispers, they're quiet.
[2606.69s - 2608.81s] And I think if we just lean into that,
[2608.81s - 2611.13s] it may just be the little voice in your head that says,
[2611.13s - 2613.56s] you love organizing birthdays.
[2613.56s - 2614.48s] Why don't you just organize
[2614.48s - 2616.98s] a couple more birthday parties this year?
[2616.98s - 2618.80s] Oh, you're really good at event planning.
[2618.80s - 2620.94s] Why don't you help your friend with their wedding?
[2620.94s - 2621.76s] Oh, you know what?
[2621.76s - 2623.62s] You're really, really good at writing.
[2623.62s - 2626.22s] Why don't you just write a quote every day?
[2626.42s - 2627.78s] It's that little voice.
[2627.78s - 2629.58s] So just follow the whisper.
[2629.58s - 2631.62s] Do you think that your life, if you look backwards,
[2631.62s - 2634.38s] also provides answers for what energizes you?
[2634.38s - 2637.64s] Because I think it's a very important point to validate
[2637.64s - 2640.14s] that we are at a moment in time
[2640.14s - 2644.06s] where the research bears out that over 80% of us
[2644.06s - 2647.82s] are living in a state of chronic stress.
[2647.82s - 2652.82s] The feeling of being numb is very, very common right now
[2653.22s - 2655.98s] and probably a sign that you're actually mentally well
[2655.98s - 2658.50s] because there's so much chaos and overwhelm and stuff.
[2658.50s - 2661.60s] But so validating that,
[2661.60s - 2665.22s] and even if somebody turns inward and doesn't quite feel it,
[2665.22s - 2668.30s] are there other things that someone can do
[2668.30s - 2671.06s] that you would recommend to help access that
[2671.06s - 2672.38s] if you're just at a point where you just,
[2672.38s - 2675.26s] I am so spent, I don't even know myself anymore?
[2675.26s - 2677.46s] I promise you, and I really mean this,
[2677.46s - 2680.82s] and I want everyone to really internalize this as I say,
[2680.82s - 2684.22s] you are already successful at something.
[2684.26s - 2686.46s] It's just so easy to you
[2686.46s - 2688.50s] that you don't think of it as success.
[2688.50s - 2691.06s] There's something that comes effortlessly to you.
[2691.06s - 2693.66s] Maybe you graduate college with flying collars.
[2693.66s - 2697.34s] Maybe you take care of your kids in the best way possible.
[2697.34s - 2699.34s] Maybe you're just incredible
[2699.34s - 2701.46s] as showing up for your work colleagues.
[2701.46s - 2704.74s] You already are extremely, incredibly successful
[2704.74s - 2707.42s] at something, but because it's easy for you
[2707.42s - 2710.46s] and natural for you, you don't think it's a skill.
[2710.46s - 2712.42s] So look back at your life
[2712.42s - 2716.14s] and look back at all the things that you've done beautifully.
[2716.14s - 2718.10s] You showed up for your friends at college.
[2718.10s - 2720.18s] You helped your colleagues through a tough time.
[2720.18s - 2721.98s] You've already been doing that.
[2721.98s - 2723.70s] You just don't know what that looks like
[2723.70s - 2726.02s] because you think that's what a good person does.
[2726.02s - 2727.58s] And it is what a good person does,
[2727.58s - 2729.42s] but on top of that, it is value
[2729.42s - 2731.62s] that you've been adding all along the way.
[2731.62s - 2734.02s] Look at the clues, look at the footprints,
[2734.02s - 2737.42s] look at the steps behind, and don't take the for granted.
[2737.42s - 2740.42s] Most likely, the things that you don't value
[2740.42s - 2742.42s] because they're simple to you are the things
[2742.42s - 2744.06s] that the world is looking for.
[2744.06s - 2746.14s] Radhi's cooking skill is something
[2746.14s - 2747.42s] that comes really naturally to her.
[2747.42s - 2749.22s] She's worked on it, but it's natural.
[2749.22s - 2750.62s] She doesn't, she didn't value it.
[2750.62s - 2753.46s] She didn't realize what a superpower it was.
[2753.46s - 2755.94s] So Jay, for the person who's listening,
[2755.94s - 2759.11s] who's now scanning their life
[2759.11s - 2760.63s] and thinking about what they're good at
[2760.63s - 2763.24s] and they're coming up with nothing,
[2763.24s - 2765.95s] what is your advice?
[2765.95s - 2769.03s] Here's my number one piece of advice.
[2769.03s - 2771.31s] Pick three people from your past.
[2771.31s - 2775.23s] Could be a work colleague, a family member, and a friend.
[2775.23s - 2777.43s] These are people that know you deeply,
[2777.43s - 2780.16s] that you would say, know me really, really well.
[2780.16s - 2782.20s] Not, don't go and do this with anyone else.
[2782.20s - 2784.77s] Do this with people that know you really well.
[2784.77s - 2789.15s] And just ask them, what's something that I do
[2789.15s - 2790.79s] that you always think of me
[2790.79s - 2793.08s] when you're struggling with something?
[2793.08s - 2796.00s] Ask them, what's something that I've done in the past
[2796.00s - 2798.64s] for you or for anyone around us that made you go,
[2798.64s - 2801.53s] wow, that's really cool, that's amazing.
[2801.57s - 2803.69s] And then sit down and ask them,
[2803.69s - 2806.20s] when you're struggling with something,
[2806.20s - 2807.28s] what do I help you do?
[2807.28s - 2808.80s] What do I help you solve?
[2808.80s - 2811.28s] All of a sudden you get all this input
[2811.28s - 2813.04s] from the people that know you the best
[2813.04s - 2816.36s] because they see in you what you don't see in yourself.
[2816.36s - 2818.00s] We have to remember that.
[2818.00s - 2820.24s] The people that know you and the people that love you,
[2820.24s - 2823.68s] they see in you what you don't see in yourself.
[2823.68s - 2826.80s] What you undervalue is what they deeply value.
[2826.80s - 2830.08s] What you take for granted is what they see as greatness.
[2830.08s - 2832.52s] What you kind of think is normal and average,
[2832.52s - 2834.68s] they adore about you.
[2834.68s - 2836.24s] But you've got to let them tell you that,
[2836.24s - 2838.52s] you've got to let them remind you of that
[2838.52s - 2841.46s] because otherwise you'll keep devaluing yourself.
[2841.46s - 2844.14s] You know what's interesting is that I remember,
[2845.14s - 2847.50s] this was like two years before I started the podcast.
[2847.50s - 2850.97s] I would literally listen,
[2850.97s - 2854.25s] I still listen to your podcast, Jay, and watch your videos
[2854.25s - 2857.01s] and find so much inspiration from you.
[2857.01s - 2858.85s] I didn't realize I kind of did that with you
[2858.85s - 2860.85s] because I was very stuck.
[2860.85s - 2865.33s] I had reached a point where I was so tired of being on planes
[2865.33s - 2868.45s] and doing the motivational speaking at corporate events,
[2868.45s - 2870.01s] even though I loved it.
[2870.01s - 2874.25s] And I so wanted to get into the podcasting space.
[2874.25s - 2876.49s] And I always know when I want something
[2876.49s - 2881.49s] because unlike you who is a very loving and positive person,
[2882.89s - 2885.49s] my signs show up as jealousy.
[2885.49s - 2887.41s] I don't have the Monk version.
[2887.45s - 2890.09s] I have the Mel Robbins version of inspiration.
[2890.09s - 2893.17s] It's sort of in that agitation, right?
[2893.17s - 2895.97s] And so you have this incredible podcast
[2895.97s - 2900.97s] and I literally felt so jealous and excited for you
[2901.25s - 2904.77s] but jealous because I'm doing it.
[2904.77s - 2906.53s] That means I can't do it.
[2906.53s - 2910.41s] And it's already done and since he's already doing it,
[2910.41s - 2912.61s] he's just such a great job with On Purpose
[2912.61s - 2914.05s] and the most perfect name.
[2914.05s - 2918.53s] And you kind of see it in somebody else
[2918.53s - 2920.84s] and you literally said to me,
[2920.84s - 2923.60s] Mel, you know what you should be doing?
[2923.60s - 2925.64s] When are you gonna launch a podcast?
[2925.64s - 2927.36s] Like you would destroy it.
[2927.36s - 2932.36s] And so you reflected to me the thing that you saw
[2932.88s - 2937.00s] as the next thing that made the most sense.
[2937.00s - 2939.76s] And so I love that advice because the people
[2939.76s - 2943.12s] who do know you well can see the things
[2943.12s - 2944.48s] that you don't see in yourself
[2944.48s - 2947.88s] or see the possibilities
[2947.88s - 2952.56s] that you are actively holding yourself back from.
[2952.56s - 2953.76s] You know, one of the things that you've said
[2953.76s - 2956.40s] that I also love is you said weak people focus
[2956.40s - 2958.24s] on others' weaknesses,
[2958.24s - 2960.24s] strong people focus on their strengths.
[2960.24s - 2961.88s] Can you unpack that?
[2961.88s - 2964.56s] Yeah, it actually perfectly fits with what you just said.
[2964.56s - 2970.00s] So weak people notice other people's mistakes and laugh.
[2971.00s - 2976.68s] Strong people notice other people's mistakes and learn.
[2976.68s - 2980.56s] Weak people talk about other people's problems
[2980.56s - 2982.08s] to feel better.
[2982.08s - 2985.08s] Strong people talk about other people's problems
[2985.08s - 2986.80s] to become better.
[2986.80s - 2990.04s] Weak people gossip about others
[2990.04s - 2992.20s] to build fake connections.
[2992.20s - 2997.45s] Strong people express vulnerability to build real ones.
[2997.73s - 3000.57s] And this one's the kicker that you were just talking about.
[3000.93s - 3004.45s] Weak people envy people ahead of them.
[3004.45s - 3008.36s] Strong people study people ahead of them.
[3008.36s - 3011.16s] And the interesting thing is both people
[3011.16s - 3013.12s] are looking at the same thing,
[3013.12s - 3015.20s] but they're seeing different things
[3015.20s - 3018.44s] because no one is a weak or strong person.
[3018.44s - 3020.44s] It's just what you focus on.
[3020.44s - 3022.20s] And that's what I want people to realize.
[3022.20s - 3023.48s] There's a switch.
[3023.48s - 3026.64s] The switch for envy is study.
[3026.64s - 3027.80s] If you're jealous of someone,
[3027.80s - 3029.96s] if you're envious of someone, study them.
[3029.96s - 3032.08s] And I know we've had so many conversations
[3032.08s - 3034.16s] where we've both taught each other so much stuff.
[3034.16s - 3036.64s] You've always been so kind to share so many insights
[3036.64s - 3037.48s] and lessons.
[3037.48s - 3039.40s] I know I've done the same with you.
[3039.40s - 3040.24s] That's what we do.
[3040.24s - 3041.80s] We study each other.
[3041.80s - 3043.04s] And all of a sudden,
[3043.04s - 3047.32s] that envy turns into appreciation, admiration,
[3047.32s - 3049.48s] just complete awe,
[3049.48s - 3052.36s] because you're like, now I know what it takes, right?
[3052.36s - 3055.32s] I remember when I used to see Cristiano Ronaldo,
[3055.32s - 3057.52s] who I'm a huge fan of,
[3057.52s - 3061.48s] and I've been a fan of him ever since he was 17 years old.
[3061.48s - 3063.72s] And so I must have been like 14 or something like that
[3063.72s - 3065.36s] when I started following him.
[3065.36s - 3066.60s] This is 20 years ago now,
[3066.60s - 3068.72s] you're talking about more than that.
[3068.72s - 3071.36s] And you look at him and you think, oh my God,
[3071.36s - 3074.72s] like look how he looks, look how he plays everything else.
[3074.72s - 3078.00s] The moment you start studying his routine,
[3078.00s - 3080.28s] you realize what it actually takes.
[3080.28s - 3083.04s] Someone can sit there and envy and be jealous of his life,
[3083.04s - 3083.88s] which is natural by the way.
[3083.88s - 3086.04s] And I don't want to make that seem like a bad thing,
[3086.04s - 3089.04s] but you turn jealousy into study.
[3089.04s - 3091.40s] You turn envy into study and all of a sudden,
[3091.40s - 3092.60s] it's your best friend.
[3092.60s - 3094.44s] Envy can be your best friend
[3094.44s - 3096.28s] if you just replace it for study.
[3096.28s - 3098.08s] 100%, I love that.
[3098.08s - 3100.48s] And that's exactly what I did.
[3100.48s - 3102.36s] The thing that's interesting is that,
[3102.36s - 3104.28s] the reason why I wanted to highlight
[3104.28s - 3107.20s] that jealousy can be a useful tool.
[3107.20s - 3109.48s] Jealousy for me is very different than envy,
[3109.48s - 3110.80s] because when I would look at you,
[3110.80s - 3115.52s] I would never envy you like you don't deserve that.
[3115.52s - 3119.56s] Jealousy for me is this deep stirring,
[3119.56s - 3122.48s] because it's impossible to be jealous
[3122.48s - 3124.80s] of something that's not meant for you.
[3124.80s - 3127.08s] And so I've never been jealous of anybody
[3127.08s - 3128.64s] who drives a Lamborghini.
[3128.64s - 3130.36s] I've never been jealous of anybody
[3130.36s - 3132.28s] that lives in a penthouse apartment.
[3132.28s - 3134.00s] I've never, you know what I'm saying?
[3134.00s - 3135.88s] I don't want those things.
[3135.88s - 3137.56s] But there was something about the way
[3137.56s - 3139.68s] that you took something that energizes you,
[3139.68s - 3143.40s] learning, connection, purpose.
[3143.40s - 3148.04s] And you created a business that was in service to others
[3148.04s - 3149.80s] around the things that energize you.
[3149.80s - 3152.56s] And that's what was, I think, ultimately,
[3152.56s - 3154.76s] the thing that was stirring something in me.
[3154.76s - 3157.32s] And that's a super, super useful tool.
[3157.32s - 3159.32s] But the other thing I wanted to validate
[3159.32s - 3161.56s] is that the second I said,
[3161.56s - 3162.76s] I'm gonna walk toward this thing.
[3162.76s - 3164.40s] I'm gonna figure this out.
[3164.40s - 3168.84s] I spent two years studying you, talking to you,
[3168.84s - 3172.00s] and that piece of allowing yourself,
[3172.00s - 3172.96s] and it goes back to what you said
[3173.00s - 3176.88s] about the experiment, learn, reflect.
[3176.88s - 3180.12s] And part of reflecting is experiment with something.
[3181.40s - 3182.88s] I was a student for two years.
[3182.88s - 3185.48s] There's a reason why we came out of the gate
[3185.48s - 3188.32s] and launched two episodes a week.
[3188.32s - 3190.20s] It's because I learned from you
[3190.20s - 3194.60s] that if you do want to have a successful show,
[3194.60s - 3197.00s] you have to do at least that many episodes.
[3197.00s - 3201.64s] And so the learning part and the studying others
[3201.64s - 3204.88s] and allowing others to lead the way and to show you
[3204.88s - 3209.88s] and to truly flip envy into learning from somebody,
[3211.08s - 3215.48s] that is worth $100 million in your life
[3215.48s - 3218.92s] to understand that everybody that is out
[3218.92s - 3222.84s] in the world right now is somebody that you can learn from.
[3222.84s - 3224.36s] It's just unbelievable.
[3224.36s - 3227.60s] And so thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing that.
[3227.60s - 3229.00s] And there's another quote that you have
[3229.00s - 3231.12s] that I absolutely love, Jay.
[3231.12s - 3233.52s] We judge others by their actions,
[3233.52s - 3236.24s] but ourselves by our intentions.
[3236.24s - 3237.28s] What does that mean?
[3237.28s - 3239.76s] This is something that actually my monk teachers
[3239.76s - 3241.84s] used to repeat to us a lot.
[3241.84s - 3245.28s] And it's a reality check that's a bit of a punch in the gut.
[3246.47s - 3249.95s] So we judge ourselves by our intentions
[3249.95s - 3253.08s] and we judge other people by their actions.
[3253.08s - 3255.88s] So if we feel our intention was good,
[3255.88s - 3257.92s] we feel we're good people.
[3257.92s - 3260.40s] But if someone has a bad action,
[3260.40s - 3262.40s] we feel they're bad people.
[3262.40s - 3266.08s] Whereas what we should be doing is allowing other people
[3266.08s - 3270.32s] to be judged also for their intentions and their actions.
[3270.32s - 3275.04s] So it's a plea, a proposal, a pledge
[3275.04s - 3277.40s] to say before you judge someone,
[3277.40s - 3280.08s] before you put someone in a box,
[3280.08s - 3283.12s] please learn what their intention was.
[3283.12s - 3285.52s] Because often you'll find that their intention
[3285.52s - 3288.04s] probably wasn't as malicious as you think.
[3288.04s - 3290.24s] It wasn't as manipulative as you think.
[3290.24s - 3293.32s] It wasn't as crazy as you think.
[3293.32s - 3294.76s] It was the same as yours.
[3294.76s - 3296.68s] They too had good intentions.
[3296.68s - 3299.48s] They also got into it with good intentions.
[3299.48s - 3301.32s] But we judge ourselves by our intentions
[3301.32s - 3302.92s] so we think we're good people.
[3302.92s - 3304.48s] And we judge other people by their actions
[3304.48s - 3306.04s] and so we think they're bad people.
[3306.04s - 3311.06s] If I made a mistake and you judge me for my action,
[3311.06s - 3312.82s] all of a sudden you've labeled me.
[3312.82s - 3315.86s] But my intention was so pure and so genuine.
[3315.86s - 3319.62s] I'll give you an example of something that happened recently
[3319.62s - 3323.38s] to me that I feel really, really applies to this.
[3323.38s - 3328.49s] And I was doing something with a friend
[3328.49s - 3332.73s] and we did a podcast together
[3332.73s - 3337.20s] and I was traveling on the road or whatever
[3337.20s - 3340.68s] and I didn't post something about it.
[3340.68s - 3343.16s] And my friend messaged me
[3343.16s - 3345.20s] and was just feeling really upset
[3345.20s - 3347.00s] that I hadn't supported them,
[3347.00s - 3349.48s] that I hadn't noticed them, that I hadn't recognized them.
[3349.48s - 3350.64s] And now we're really good friends
[3350.64s - 3353.08s] so they were able to vocalize it to me.
[3353.08s - 3355.24s] But if we weren't, they would have immediately judged
[3355.24s - 3358.76s] and thought that I had some ulterior motive or some agenda.
[3358.76s - 3361.08s] And the truth is I'm so disconnected from my social media
[3361.08s - 3362.44s] in the sense that I don't post.
[3362.44s - 3364.24s] I'm not there, I'm on the road.
[3364.24s - 3366.88s] I try and stay off my phone for most of the day.
[3366.88s - 3368.28s] And all of a sudden I was thinking,
[3368.28s - 3372.05s] wait a minute, if they judge me for my action,
[3372.05s - 3373.85s] it looks like I don't care about them.
[3373.85s - 3375.49s] It looks like I don't value them.
[3375.49s - 3377.65s] It looks like this isn't important to me.
[3377.65s - 3379.61s] But my intention was, I love you,
[3379.61s - 3380.69s] you're one of my favorite people.
[3380.69s - 3382.73s] I'm here to help you in whatever way possible.
[3382.73s - 3386.05s] And I just think about the amount of friendships we'd save,
[3386.05s - 3388.69s] the amount of relationships we'd save
[3388.69s - 3392.97s] if we just learned to judge people for their intentions,
[3392.97s - 3394.29s] not their actions.
[3394.29s - 3395.81s] Do you have like a little trick?
[3395.81s - 3400.81s] Cause my like emotions and pettiness can just flood me.
[3401.89s - 3404.17s] Like I've never had training as a monk, Jay.
[3404.17s - 3406.61s] So I would imagine like your sort of engine
[3406.65s - 3408.01s] doesn't ravish high as mine,
[3408.01s - 3413.01s] but it is so easy to see friends out together.
[3413.09s - 3416.89s] And then immediately judge them for their actions
[3416.89s - 3418.01s] that they're excluding you,
[3418.01s - 3419.57s] that they must be talking about you,
[3419.57s - 3422.53s] that now they're closer than you are to them,
[3422.53s - 3425.25s] that it means something, it means you did something.
[3425.25s - 3427.89s] And then of course you respond to all of that emotion.
[3427.89s - 3430.77s] We are so fast to assume.
[3430.77s - 3432.93s] Is there anything that you do
[3432.93s - 3435.81s] or that you recommend that people do?
[3435.85s - 3436.69s] Mel, there's this thing.
[3436.69s - 3437.77s] I don't know if you've heard of it.
[3437.77s - 3439.21s] It's called the Latin theory.
[3439.21s - 3441.13s] Jay.
[3441.13s - 3441.97s] Sorry, I had to.
[3441.97s - 3444.29s] I had to, I was waiting for you there.
[3444.29s - 3445.49s] Which is really good.
[3445.49s - 3447.01s] There's let them and then let me in it.
[3447.01s - 3447.85s] And it works perfectly,
[3447.85s - 3450.01s] which I genuinely believe it's amazing.
[3450.01s - 3453.45s] But to answer your question, I'll be honest with you.
[3453.45s - 3456.76s] When it's people that I know, I tell them.
[3457.88s - 3460.52s] I really believe it's important to tell people.
[3460.52s - 3462.76s] I check in with them, I ask them.
[3462.76s - 3466.28s] Because if I know you, our relationship,
[3466.28s - 3470.34s] if our relationship means I can't ask you the question,
[3470.34s - 3472.64s] then it's a weak relationship.
[3472.64s - 3475.08s] If I ask you the question and we have a great conversation,
[3475.08s - 3477.40s] now our relationship is strengthened by it.
[3477.40s - 3479.16s] We actually got closer.
[3479.16s - 3484.04s] A hard conversation should make you closer to the person.
[3484.04s - 3485.68s] A hard conversation should not make you
[3485.68s - 3487.24s] further away from them.
[3487.24s - 3489.91s] Say that again, Jay.
[3489.91s - 3493.35s] If you love someone and they say they love you,
[3493.39s - 3497.59s] a hard conversation should bring you closer together.
[3497.59s - 3501.03s] A hard conversation should not push you away from each other.
[3501.03s - 3503.71s] If you're scared to have a hard conversation
[3503.71s - 3507.03s] with someone you love, that means you're not that close.
[3507.03s - 3509.59s] Dude, I think those are the hardest people to talk to though.
[3509.59s - 3512.11s] Yeah, but that should be the easiest person to talk to
[3512.11s - 3514.59s] because you should be able to have a safe space to raise it.
[3514.59s - 3517.87s] And so if I'm close to someone, if it was me and you,
[3517.87s - 3518.79s] I would call you up.
[3518.79s - 3521.47s] And I actually trust we'd have a great conversation
[3521.47s - 3522.31s] because of it.
[3522.31s - 3523.15s] I know that.
[3523.15s - 3525.07s] I actually believe that if we ever had anything like that,
[3525.07s - 3526.99s] which we haven't and I would call you.
[3526.99s - 3530.74s] But what I find is, if you can't call the person,
[3530.74s - 3532.34s] I would just think about,
[3532.34s - 3533.90s] this is the second part of that statement.
[3533.90s - 3535.74s] My monk teachers would always say,
[3535.74s - 3540.74s] instead of judging people by their actions,
[3541.21s - 3543.37s] judge them by their intentions
[3543.37s - 3547.73s] and judge yourself by your actions, not your intentions.
[3547.73s - 3551.09s] Oh, think about all the stupid things you've said,
[3551.13s - 3553.45s] you've done and got wrong.
[3553.45s - 3556.49s] And all of a sudden you start to recognize,
[3556.49s - 3559.25s] wait a minute, if someone judged me for that,
[3559.25s - 3560.77s] I'd feel pretty bad about it.
[3560.77s - 3561.77s] That doesn't define me.
[3561.77s - 3562.97s] That's not who I am.
[3562.97s - 3565.33s] And all of a sudden when you have that reflection,
[3565.33s - 3567.33s] it flips the entire statement.
[3567.33s - 3569.65s] Wait a minute, that can't be who I am
[3569.65s - 3571.65s] and that's not who they are.
[3571.65s - 3572.73s] Amazing.
[3572.73s - 3574.61s] Here's another thing that you said recently, Jay,
[3574.61s - 3575.45s] that I love.
[3575.45s - 3580.53s] Someone out there would love to live your worst day.
[3580.57s - 3584.60s] What does that mean?
[3584.60s - 3588.27s] We're really quick to forget
[3588.27s - 3590.51s] that the day we're living today
[3590.51s - 3593.60s] is a day we dreamed of 10 years ago.
[3593.60s - 3597.30s] Maybe not in a complete picture.
[3597.30s - 3599.84s] Maybe you have the family you always wished for.
[3599.84s - 3601.54s] Maybe you're on the career path
[3601.54s - 3603.57s] that you've worked really hard for.
[3603.57s - 3607.01s] Maybe you're sitting in the home
[3607.01s - 3610.25s] that you couldn't even have imagined living in.
[3610.25s - 3612.17s] But there's a part of your life
[3612.17s - 3614.89s] that is exactly the life that you wanted.
[3614.89s - 3617.56s] Not all of it, but there's a part of it.
[3617.56s - 3619.76s] And when you forget that,
[3619.76s - 3622.59s] you lose out on recognizing
[3622.59s - 3624.83s] you're already living in the dream
[3624.83s - 3627.27s] and that you already have the power
[3627.27s - 3629.09s] to create that future dream
[3629.09s - 3631.67s] because you've already done it once.
[3631.67s - 3634.91s] So you have to remember that where you are today
[3634.91s - 3636.71s] is what you wanted yesterday.
[3636.71s - 3639.35s] And what you want today, you can create tomorrow
[3639.35s - 3641.51s] because you've already done it once.
[3641.55s - 3643.75s] But we forget it so quickly.
[3643.75s - 3646.23s] I have to remind myself all the time, Mel.
[3646.23s - 3651.84s] I was driving to one of my friends' homes the other day.
[3652.28s - 3656.04s] And this is a friend that I used to grow up
[3656.04s - 3659.02s] watching on television, watching their movies,
[3659.02s - 3661.14s] listening to their music.
[3661.14s - 3665.03s] And they've become one of my closest friends in life.
[3665.03s - 3666.61s] And I had to pinch myself.
[3666.61s - 3668.39s] Now we've been friends for like seven years.
[3668.39s - 3669.79s] I had to pinch myself to be like,
[3669.79s - 3671.47s] do I know what I'm doing?
[3671.91s - 3675.39s] I have to go back to being at the beginning of that journey
[3675.39s - 3677.99s] because otherwise you can take anything for granted.
[3677.99s - 3679.79s] It's like you get to the top of a mountain
[3679.79s - 3683.11s] after a long hike and you look at a view.
[3683.11s - 3685.03s] You can get really familiar and bored
[3685.03s - 3687.39s] of that view really, really quick
[3687.39s - 3690.87s] unless you recognize the challenge it took,
[3690.87s - 3694.15s] the steps you took, the person you saw on the way up.
[3694.15s - 3696.63s] You have to sit there and remember all of that.
[3696.63s - 3698.19s] But the memory does this weird thing
[3698.19s - 3699.51s] where it just forgets it.
[3699.55s - 3701.83s] As soon as you achieve something,
[3701.83s - 3705.15s] you forget how you dreamt of achieving it.
[3705.15s - 3707.07s] As soon as you get somewhere,
[3707.07s - 3710.19s] you forget how once upon a time,
[3710.19s - 3712.67s] you couldn't even imagine getting there.
[3712.67s - 3716.05s] Where you are today is what you wanted yesterday.
[3716.05s - 3717.81s] And don't forget how you got there
[3717.81s - 3720.13s] because that's the hidden secret
[3720.13s - 3723.00s] of how you get to the next place.
[3723.00s - 3725.28s] How do you use gratitude
[3727.30s - 3730.42s] to lift yourself up in a moment
[3730.42s - 3733.58s] that is extraordinarily difficult?
[3733.58s - 3736.14s] You're grieving, you're in the middle of a breakup
[3736.14s - 3738.14s] or a divorce, you've lost your job.
[3738.14s - 3741.70s] Is there a way to use gratitude to lift yourself up
[3741.70s - 3744.90s] when life just really has knocked you down?
[3744.90s - 3747.12s] When life's knocked you down,
[3747.12s - 3751.88s] it's hard to be grateful for the good things in your life.
[3752.92s - 3755.32s] And it's sometimes bad advice
[3755.36s - 3757.88s] because someone's just lost a marriage,
[3757.88s - 3760.16s] lost a family member, whatever it may be.
[3760.16s - 3762.28s] So there's the time for grieving, of course.
[3762.28s - 3763.12s] Absolutely.
[3763.12s - 3764.68s] And that's the mentally healthy response
[3764.68s - 3767.48s] to have the avalanche of emotions.
[3767.48s - 3769.52s] But if you're gonna be grateful,
[3769.52s - 3773.12s] you sometimes have to do a counterintuitive practice.
[3773.12s - 3776.28s] Instead of being grateful for what you have,
[3776.28s - 3779.64s] think about how your life would be without something.
[3779.64s - 3783.84s] I find that to be the greatest thing for gratitude.
[3783.84s - 3785.64s] If I try and be grateful
[3785.64s - 3787.92s] for something that I've had for a long time,
[3787.92s - 3790.44s] I may get bored of it, I may be familiar with it.
[3790.44s - 3793.60s] But if I ask myself, what would my life be without that?
[3793.60s - 3796.92s] Oh my gosh, all of a sudden, I'm so grateful.
[3796.92s - 3798.52s] What would my life be without?
[3798.52s - 3800.48s] Have you ever had it where you just like,
[3800.48s - 3803.16s] hurt your little finger or like get a little cut
[3803.16s - 3804.68s] and now you can't use a finger
[3804.68s - 3806.56s] or you can't use a thumb and all of a sudden you're like,
[3806.56s - 3808.80s] oh my God, I'm so grateful for my hand
[3808.80s - 3810.80s] because what would my life be like without it?
[3810.80s - 3813.08s] This is the way we have to trick our mind.
[3813.12s - 3815.52s] Humans are better at noticing something
[3815.52s - 3816.56s] when it's about to go away.
[3816.56s - 3817.88s] We always hear the phrase,
[3817.88s - 3820.20s] you don't know what you've got until it's gone.
[3820.20s - 3822.80s] So we have to use that in our favor to think,
[3822.80s - 3825.28s] not what do I have that I'm so grateful for,
[3825.28s - 3826.92s] what could I not live without?
[3826.92s - 3828.88s] That is life changing.
[3828.88s - 3830.48s] I've never actually thought about it like that.
[3830.48s - 3832.44s] I was sitting there the moment you said it
[3832.44s - 3837.03s] and I thought, how would I feel if Jay wasn't in my life?
[3837.03s - 3839.31s] And I'm grateful for you,
[3839.31s - 3843.75s] but the second I envision you, sorry, Jay, evaporating
[3843.75s - 3847.31s] and not knowing you as a friend, it's like it 10 X'd it.
[3847.31s - 3850.87s] And even the example of, you know, you said the finger,
[3850.87s - 3853.31s] like I was in the hotel the other night
[3853.31s - 3855.71s] and I was walking to the bathroom, of course,
[3855.71s - 3858.51s] it's a 56 year old woman at three o'clock in the morning
[3858.51s - 3860.71s] and I hit my toe on the bed frame,
[3860.71s - 3863.39s] you're gonna be like, oh, and it feels like
[3863.39s - 3865.35s] you've ripped it off your foot.
[3866.26s - 3869.94s] It's amazing to me that my experience of that
[3869.94s - 3872.86s] is screaming in agony and then thinking,
[3872.86s - 3875.42s] how can something so little hurt so much?
[3875.42s - 3879.98s] And your reframe is, imagine my life without my foot
[3879.98s - 3881.90s] and the gratitude that floods you.
[3881.90s - 3884.10s] I mean, that's incredible, Jay.
[3884.10s - 3885.22s] It really works.
[3885.22s - 3886.06s] It really works.
[3886.06s - 3886.90s] It really works.
[3886.90s - 3889.94s] It's so simple and you can apply it to small and big things
[3889.94s - 3892.42s] but even I was thinking as you were saying friendship,
[3892.42s - 3894.18s] I was thinking about our friend Dave Hollis.
[3894.18s - 3895.18s] Oh yeah.
[3895.26s - 3900.18s] And you know, it's, I know you spoke at his funeral
[3900.18s - 3901.70s] and I sadly couldn't be there
[3901.70s - 3903.82s] but as I'm thinking about it, I'm like,
[3903.82s - 3904.86s] I was grateful for Dave.
[3904.86s - 3907.22s] I had some really beautiful interactions with Dave.
[3907.22s - 3908.34s] I really did.
[3908.34s - 3910.72s] He was a wonderful man.
[3910.72s - 3913.00s] But it's only when you sadly lose someone
[3913.00s - 3914.56s] that you really recognize, wait a minute,
[3914.56s - 3915.88s] I can't call them again.
[3915.88s - 3917.40s] I'm not gonna get a call from him again.
[3917.40s - 3919.64s] I'm not gonna see him at our next get together.
[3919.64s - 3920.96s] And then all of a sudden, so like,
[3920.96s - 3922.24s] do that while people are here.
[3922.24s - 3923.40s] And it's not a fear thing.
[3923.40s - 3925.28s] It's a gratitude thing, right?
[3925.28s - 3926.76s] It's not like I'm living in fear
[3926.76s - 3928.68s] of what if I lose this person?
[3928.68s - 3929.72s] You're asking yourself,
[3929.72s - 3933.36s] what would my life be without this?
[3933.36s - 3935.16s] Oh my gosh, I'm so glad I have it.
[3935.16s - 3936.48s] I'm so grateful I have it.
[3936.48s - 3939.56s] I'm so lucky and fortunate I get to have this.
[3939.56s - 3942.20s] That's what you're fueling your life with, not with fear.
[3942.20s - 3945.92s] I really, I wanna thank you for that
[3945.92s - 3948.28s] because especially that last part about
[3948.28s - 3951.40s] you can actually kind of do things out of fear
[3951.40s - 3955.20s] or you can have the fuel and the energizing source of it
[3955.20s - 3956.04s] be gratitude.
[3956.04s - 3956.88s] I'll give you an example.
[3956.88s - 3957.70s] Please.
[3957.70s - 3960.48s] So my dad is 80 years old
[3960.48s - 3964.48s] and I think a lot about the fact that if I'm lucky,
[3964.48s - 3969.40s] I'm gonna get 10 more, maybe 15 more if I'm crazy lucky.
[3970.96s - 3973.68s] Holidays with him, birthdays with him.
[3973.68s - 3976.00s] And I realize as I'm listening to you
[3976.00s - 3979.82s] that I've been coming from this sense of fear
[3979.82s - 3981.66s] because there's this sense like,
[3981.66s - 3983.22s] I gotta make the most of the time that I have
[3983.22s - 3984.86s] while I have the time.
[3985.34s - 3989.18s] I can take what you just shared and say,
[3989.18s - 3992.14s] I am so grateful that he's here.
[3992.14s - 3996.62s] That I want to make use of the time that I have
[3996.62s - 4001.02s] while he's here, which is a very different energy
[4001.02s - 4002.78s] to ground yourself in.
[4002.78s - 4003.62s] You're so right.
[4003.62s - 4004.46s] You're spot on.
[4004.46s - 4007.86s] It's this idea of having the full picture.
[4007.86s - 4008.70s] Talk more about that.
[4008.70s - 4010.34s] What do you mean?
[4010.34s - 4011.18s] Yeah.
[4011.18s - 4013.58s] And I wanna approach it from a really interesting take
[4013.58s - 4015.14s] and it comes from what we were talking about
[4015.14s - 4017.73s] a few seconds ago around comparison.
[4017.73s - 4020.45s] So Mel, there's only really,
[4020.45s - 4022.33s] apart from what we said about how to turn jealousy,
[4022.33s - 4026.25s] which I love, there's really only one way
[4026.25s - 4029.04s] to overcome comparison.
[4029.04s - 4031.58s] And it's having the full picture
[4031.58s - 4034.63s] of the person you compare yourself to.
[4034.63s - 4036.51s] You've gotta know what's happening
[4036.51s - 4039.31s] behind their perfect Instagram posts.
[4039.31s - 4042.23s] Do you know how many times they cried themselves
[4042.23s - 4044.15s] to sleep this week?
[4044.15s - 4046.07s] Do you know the argument they just had
[4046.07s - 4048.20s] with their mom last night?
[4048.20s - 4049.62s] Do you know the challenge they're going through
[4049.62s - 4051.64s] with their kids right now?
[4051.64s - 4054.90s] Do you know about the family member who has an illness?
[4054.90s - 4055.74s] All of a sudden,
[4055.74s - 4059.95s] when you actually get the full picture on someone's life,
[4059.95s - 4062.35s] you now don't compare yourself to them
[4062.35s - 4065.23s] because you realize no one's life is perfect.
[4065.23s - 4067.84s] They're just better at cropping out the pain.
[4067.84s - 4069.64s] They're just better at editing out the parts
[4069.64s - 4072.08s] that they don't want you to see.
[4072.08s - 4075.48s] But when you see what someone's really going through,
[4075.48s - 4078.20s] all of a sudden you won't compare it anymore
[4078.20s - 4080.12s] because you recognize everyone's going
[4080.12s - 4081.56s] through something difficult.
[4081.56s - 4084.40s] Jay, another thing that you remind us all that I just love
[4084.40s - 4087.40s] is the bad times reveal who the great people are
[4087.40s - 4088.56s] in your life.
[4088.56s - 4092.24s] Do people show up for you when you're going
[4092.24s - 4094.20s] through a bad day?
[4094.20s - 4097.40s] Are people present for your good days
[4097.40s - 4100.30s] but absent for your bad days?
[4100.30s - 4103.34s] Do people turn up, call, check in?
[4103.38s - 4105.43s] When things are going wrong?
[4105.43s - 4109.15s] Does someone see the best in you
[4109.15s - 4111.46s] when you're your worst self?
[4111.46s - 4113.97s] Does someone see the good in you
[4113.97s - 4116.47s] when you might be having a bad day?
[4116.47s - 4121.53s] That person is more special than anyone you'll ever meet.
[4121.53s - 4123.71s] So keep them close.
[4123.71s - 4126.95s] Don't run the risk of pushing them away,
[4126.95s - 4130.65s] losing them, taking them for granted
[4130.65s - 4134.33s] because one day you'll wish that they'll call
[4134.33s - 4140.84s] and check in and you might have lost them by then.
[4140.84s - 4145.68s] So the bad times in our life genuinely show us
[4145.68s - 4149.39s] the great people because it's at that point
[4149.39s - 4152.95s] that you're hard to support, you're hard to love,
[4152.95s - 4154.87s] you're hard to give energy to.
[4154.87s - 4157.63s] It might not be popular to be your friend.
[4157.63s - 4159.19s] Which what does that prove?
[4159.19s - 4163.83s] It proves that person values you more than popularity.
[4163.83s - 4166.03s] It proves that person values you
[4166.07s - 4167.83s] more than their reputation.
[4167.83s - 4171.92s] It proves that that person values you more
[4171.92s - 4174.28s] than all the stress.
[4174.28s - 4177.40s] That is the most special person you'll ever meet
[4177.40s - 4179.80s] and everyone has at least one of them.
[4179.80s - 4182.72s] But the problem is we want attention from these people
[4182.72s - 4185.83s] so we lose affection from these people.
[4185.83s - 4187.07s] It's so true.
[4187.07s - 4188.87s] You're really good at that.
[4188.87s - 4192.65s] You're really good at showing up for your friends.
[4192.65s - 4195.19s] It's because people have shown up for me.
[4195.19s - 4196.51s] That's the reality of it.
[4196.51s - 4198.39s] I'm good at showing up for people
[4198.39s - 4200.11s] because people have shown up for me.
[4200.11s - 4202.15s] And it's not always the same people.
[4202.15s - 4203.43s] That's the mistake we make.
[4203.43s - 4205.71s] We think that the people we show up for
[4205.71s - 4208.15s] should be the people that show up back for us.
[4208.15s - 4209.27s] Oh, say more about that.
[4209.27s - 4212.95s] So we believe that when we show up for someone,
[4212.95s - 4214.67s] they should show up for us.
[4214.67s - 4219.83s] We want people to love us in the same way we love them.
[4220.07s - 4223.31s] But people won't love you the way you love them
[4223.31s - 4224.47s] and that's okay.
[4224.51s - 4226.87s] Because there's someone over here
[4226.87s - 4228.63s] who's showing up for you
[4228.63s - 4230.35s] and you're missing out on them.
[4230.35s - 4232.43s] There's someone over here who's turning up for you,
[4232.43s - 4233.87s] who's checking in on you.
[4233.87s - 4235.95s] I remember saying to my monk teacher,
[4235.95s - 4239.35s] I said, I feel like I give so much love to others.
[4239.35s - 4242.95s] I said, I feel like I show up so much for other people
[4242.95s - 4245.56s] but they don't show up for me.
[4245.56s - 4247.31s] What do I do?
[4247.31s - 4250.19s] And he said, love is like a circle.
[4250.19s - 4254.35s] Whatever love you give out will always come back to you
[4254.39s - 4256.27s] but it might just not be from those people
[4256.27s - 4258.19s] you gave it to in the first place.
[4258.19s - 4260.79s] But if you spend your whole life wondering
[4260.79s - 4263.63s] why that person doesn't give you love back,
[4263.63s - 4266.35s] you're ignoring all these people over here
[4266.35s - 4268.83s] who give you love all the time.
[4268.83s - 4271.59s] So turn around, look around you.
[4271.59s - 4273.79s] There is someone who's showing up for you,
[4273.79s - 4276.23s] turning up for you, checking in with you
[4276.23s - 4278.70s] even when you don't acknowledge them
[4278.70s - 4280.22s] and start looking towards that person
[4280.22s - 4281.86s] and giving them some respect.
[4281.86s - 4283.38s] I wanna dig deeper into that.
[4283.38s - 4284.22s] Yeah, please.
[4284.22s - 4289.51s] Because I feel like relationships
[4289.87s - 4292.67s] have become extremely transactional.
[4292.67s - 4295.15s] If I check in on you, you gotta check in on me,
[4295.15s - 4296.55s] that's the sign that you care.
[4296.55s - 4299.43s] And I love what you just said
[4299.43s - 4302.47s] that there are gonna be times where you show up for people
[4302.47s - 4304.55s] and they're not gonna show up for you
[4304.55s - 4305.71s] either because they can't
[4305.71s - 4307.43s] or they don't know what's going on
[4307.43s - 4309.11s] or they got other things going on
[4309.11s - 4311.43s] or they're not actually the right person
[4311.43s - 4314.14s] to support you right now.
[4314.14s - 4318.66s] And them showing up is gonna feel more like a burden
[4318.66s - 4320.90s] and so maybe that's also spiritually speaking
[4320.90s - 4322.70s] why they're not showing up.
[4322.70s - 4325.18s] And I love the fact that if you think about love
[4325.18s - 4329.40s] like a circle and you show up because that's who you are.
[4329.40s - 4332.72s] And in those moments when you need support,
[4332.72s - 4335.52s] recognize that there actually are people around you
[4335.52s - 4337.68s] trying to support you
[4337.68s - 4340.00s] or that are capable of it
[4340.00s - 4343.76s] if you simply let them know that you need it.
[4343.76s - 4346.36s] That's a completely different way to think about things
[4346.36s - 4349.20s] because we keep score in relationships.
[4349.20s - 4351.00s] And that if I'm the one that's always reaching out
[4351.00s - 4355.52s] to my siblings, that if they don't reach back to me
[4355.52s - 4357.84s] that it means they don't care.
[4357.84s - 4361.08s] And sometimes it actually just means
[4361.08s - 4364.28s] that's not how they express their love.
[4364.28s - 4368.08s] And that the thing that you're seeking from them
[4368.08s - 4370.60s] actually is gonna come from a friend
[4370.80s - 4373.76s] and if you're keeping score in your relationships
[4373.76s - 4376.92s] you're actually the one that's gonna destroy them.
[4376.92s - 4378.13s] Yes.
[4378.13s - 4380.37s] Can you like dig into that with me, Jay?
[4380.37s - 4381.41s] Well, that's powerful, Mel.
[4381.41s - 4384.53s] I love what you're saying and it's so true.
[4384.53s - 4389.17s] It's the first thing we have to ask ourselves is
[4389.17s - 4392.13s] did I show up for you, for you
[4392.13s - 4394.57s] or did I show up for you, for me?
[4394.57s - 4395.77s] What do you mean?
[4395.77s - 4397.73s] If I'm showing up for you, for you
[4397.73s - 4400.29s] then I don't need you to show up back for me.
[4400.33s - 4403.57s] But if I showed up to prove to you that I showed up
[4403.57s - 4405.37s] now I need you to show up back for me
[4405.37s - 4407.89s] to prove to me that I did the right thing.
[4407.89s - 4410.01s] It's almost like an insecurity of like
[4410.01s - 4412.41s] I'm doing it because I expect you to do it back
[4412.41s - 4413.89s] which is what you said at the beginning.
[4413.89s - 4415.70s] It's transactional.
[4415.70s - 4418.20s] If I do something for you
[4418.20s - 4422.04s] and I don't expect anything back, that's called love.
[4422.04s - 4425.38s] If I do something for you and I expect it back
[4425.38s - 4427.08s] that's called a transaction.
[4427.08s - 4428.48s] That's business.
[4428.48s - 4430.87s] That's a contract.
[4430.87s - 4434.13s] I don't wanna have a contract with someone I love.
[4434.13s - 4436.15s] So why would I be measuring them
[4436.15s - 4439.51s] based on how they do the exact same thing back for me?
[4439.51s - 4441.87s] If you think about that, let's say Mel
[4441.87s - 4443.59s] I organized your birthday party
[4443.59s - 4446.15s] because I love organizing birthday parties.
[4446.15s - 4449.29s] Does that mean you have to organize my birthday party
[4449.29s - 4451.71s] to show me you love me equally?
[4451.71s - 4453.79s] What if you didn't organize my birthday party
[4453.79s - 4457.55s] but you called me when I had a really tough day at work
[4457.55s - 4458.63s] and you checked in with me
[4458.63s - 4460.79s] and gave me some great wisdom and insight.
[4460.79s - 4462.31s] Is that equal?
[4462.31s - 4464.59s] Or actually do I see that as not equal
[4464.59s - 4467.43s] because you didn't spend seven days or seven months
[4467.43s - 4468.59s] planning an event for me?
[4468.59s - 4472.29s] Now are we counting time or are we measuring emotion?
[4472.29s - 4473.91s] How do you value to?
[4473.91s - 4475.77s] I can't value you based on the hours
[4475.77s - 4476.69s] you put into our friendship.
[4476.69s - 4478.59s] Let's say that I was struggling something
[4478.59s - 4480.89s] and you sent me a text
[4480.89s - 4482.75s] but when you were struggling I called you up.
[4482.75s - 4484.41s] Does that mean I care more about you?
[4484.41s - 4486.83s] Or was that text just perfect for what I needed?
[4486.83s - 4489.77s] We're measuring these very immeasurable things.
[4489.81s - 4494.29s] Are we counting days, hours, months, emotions, laughs?
[4494.29s - 4496.21s] What are you gonna keep a score on?
[4496.21s - 4498.19s] And so I think we're keeping a score on things
[4498.19s - 4499.89s] that you can't measure.
[4499.89s - 4504.25s] And this is one of the limits I have with the love languages.
[4504.25s - 4506.61s] I actually don't want you to love me
[4506.61s - 4508.69s] the way I wanna be loved.
[4508.69s - 4510.33s] What do you mean by that?
[4510.33s - 4513.41s] I believe that if I want you to love me
[4513.41s - 4516.29s] exactly the way I want to be loved,
[4516.29s - 4519.17s] I'm actually limiting how much you can love me
[4519.21s - 4521.82s] because you have something to offer me
[4521.82s - 4525.58s] that is different to what I even know I can receive.
[4525.58s - 4526.82s] So if I say to you, Mel,
[4526.82s - 4529.44s] the only way you can show me love is gifts
[4529.44s - 4532.00s] because that's what blows my mind.
[4532.00s - 4534.28s] That's great, I do like gifts.
[4534.28s - 4535.12s] But guess what?
[4535.12s - 4539.12s] What if your best way to offer love is acts of service?
[4539.12s - 4542.48s] What if your best way of love is quality time?
[4542.48s - 4545.28s] Now I'm gonna miss out on the greatness
[4545.28s - 4546.62s] you have to offer me
[4546.62s - 4549.08s] because I'm gonna say I only want you to give me this.
[4549.12s - 4551.08s] What if you wanted to give me the world?
[4551.08s - 4552.64s] And I said, just give me a gift.
[4552.64s - 4557.64s] So I'm limiting how much love, so when love matures,
[4558.36s - 4561.72s] I think when love is young, it's a great principle.
[4561.72s - 4565.04s] But when love matures, and by the way,
[4565.04s - 4566.16s] me and Radhi have been through this.
[4566.16s - 4568.88s] When I met Radhi, I was that guy, so I love gifts.
[4568.88s - 4571.56s] And I had to do a lot of unpacking as to why I love gifts.
[4571.56s - 4572.64s] Why do you love gifts?
[4572.64s - 4575.16s] It's because my mom couldn't always be there
[4575.16s - 4576.00s] for me on my birthday.
[4576.00s - 4576.92s] We couldn't spend quality time.
[4576.92s - 4578.40s] She was working, she was the breadwinner,
[4578.44s - 4579.84s] but she always got me that one gift.
[4579.84s - 4582.08s] I'd come home and the Power Ranger would be wrapped up there
[4582.08s - 4584.36s] and I'd unwrap it and I'd have so much joy.
[4584.36s - 4587.40s] So when I met Radhi, Radhi comes from a family
[4587.40s - 4589.64s] where quality time is the gift.
[4589.64s - 4591.12s] They don't really give each other gifts,
[4591.12s - 4592.68s] which to me, when I first met her, I was like,
[4592.68s - 4595.84s] this is bizarre and what is wrong with all of you?
[4595.84s - 4598.60s] And I wanted, this is ridiculous,
[4598.60s - 4601.46s] but I remember the new iPad mini was out
[4601.46s - 4604.44s] and I'd kind of hinted to her that I wanted this iPad mini.
[4604.44s - 4607.08s] Anyway, I unwrapped my gift on my birthday
[4607.08s - 4609.24s] and it's an aces.
[4609.24s - 4611.20s] I was like, I wanted an iPad mini.
[4611.20s - 4612.76s] Who gets someone an aces?
[4612.76s - 4616.68s] And it sounds ridiculous,
[4616.68s - 4619.64s] but I'm telling it because of how ridiculous we can be.
[4619.64s - 4621.32s] And she literally said to me, she was like,
[4621.32s - 4623.00s] oh no, but I asked my family and they said,
[4623.00s - 4624.28s] this one's got better specs
[4624.28s - 4626.16s] and it's actually better than the iPad
[4626.16s - 4627.16s] and it's better resolution.
[4627.16s - 4629.24s] I was like, but I wanted the iPad.
[4629.24s - 4632.38s] And I'm telling this story because
[4632.38s - 4636.34s] Radhi and me learned as our relationship developed,
[4636.38s - 4639.58s] that Radhi had so many beautiful ways to show me love
[4639.58s - 4642.54s] and she turned up in so many amazing ways,
[4642.54s - 4644.26s] but I would ignore all of them
[4644.26s - 4646.48s] because I didn't get a gift on my birthday
[4646.48s - 4648.62s] or the gift I wanted on my birthday.
[4648.62s - 4652.94s] And I think so many of us are ignoring the amazing ways
[4652.94s - 4656.56s] our partners, our kids, our parents show up for us
[4656.56s - 4660.74s] because they don't show up in exactly the way we want.
[4660.74s - 4665.08s] And here's the point, no one will ever love you
[4665.08s - 4668.00s] exactly how you want
[4668.00s - 4671.72s] because that's your job and that's God's job.
[4671.72s - 4676.60s] We will wish, wait, want every single week, month and year
[4676.60s - 4680.00s] for someone to love us in a particular exact way
[4680.00s - 4683.64s] and they will always fail us because that was your job.
[4683.64s - 4685.22s] It was never theirs in the first place.
[4685.22s - 4686.06s] That was God's job.
[4686.06s - 4688.20s] It was never theirs in the first place.
[4688.20s - 4691.24s] So open yourself up to the limitless love
[4691.24s - 4692.28s] that people show up.
[4692.28s - 4695.40s] Maybe your partner makes you coffee in the morning.
[4695.40s - 4697.80s] Maybe they're the ones that make the bed.
[4697.80s - 4699.28s] Maybe they're the one when you're on the road
[4699.28s - 4700.80s] to check in with you and order something
[4700.80s - 4702.08s] to your hotel room.
[4702.08s - 4704.10s] Maybe they're the one that reminds you
[4704.10s - 4706.28s] that you forgot your glasses or your wallet.
[4706.28s - 4707.94s] Maybe they're the one that remembers
[4707.94s - 4711.08s] to put the dishes away, whatever it is.
[4711.08s - 4713.00s] They're doing something and it's love.
[4713.00s - 4714.36s] They may not say I love you.
[4714.36s - 4717.88s] It may not look like I love you, but it is.
[4717.88s - 4719.08s] And by the way, when you tell them,
[4719.08s - 4720.60s] hey, you didn't get me this one thing
[4720.60s - 4723.00s] or you didn't say this one thing,
[4723.00s - 4726.83s] they're thinking, how did you miss all of the other things?
[4726.83s - 4727.67s] And guess what?
[4727.67s - 4729.71s] You discourage them from loving you.
[4729.71s - 4732.23s] You don't encourage someone to love you
[4732.23s - 4734.43s] by telling them you're disappointed.
[4734.43s - 4737.03s] No one's gonna give you more because you made them feel bad.
[4737.03s - 4740.11s] People love you more when they see you noticed
[4740.11s - 4742.15s] all the little things they did.
[4742.15s - 4746.69s] And all of a sudden they feel inspired to give you more.
[4746.69s - 4753.71s] Jay, it really, as I was listening to you,
[4755.12s - 4756.96s] as I was listening to you,
[4756.96s - 4758.84s] I was first of all thinking about what an asshole
[4758.84s - 4760.80s] I am in my marriage, so thanks a lot.
[4762.72s - 4763.56s] We love you, Chris.
[4765.84s - 4768.52s] Because I so saw myself, right?
[4768.52s - 4769.88s] And then- Me too, by the way.
[4769.88s - 4774.74s] Yeah, and then something extraordinary happened
[4774.74s - 4780.05s] as I was listening to you.
[4780.05s - 4786.52s] And that is, what a shame that most of us are so busy
[4787.52s - 4792.56s] looking for the one way we expect to be loved
[4793.12s - 4796.44s] that we miss all of the love that is around us
[4796.44s - 4799.74s] and available to us that we don't let in.
[4799.74s - 4804.59s] And what an opportunity to have a shift
[4804.59s - 4810.68s] and really change the way that you see life,
[4811.22s - 4817.08s] you see relationships and what you open yourself up to.
[4817.08s - 4822.24s] If there's one thing from that perspective
[4822.72s - 4824.52s] and what you learned about yourself
[4824.52s - 4826.16s] and what you learned about what's possible
[4826.16s - 4830.72s] that being loved the way you want to be loved is your job.
[4830.72s - 4833.08s] It's God's job, it's the universe's job,
[4833.08s - 4835.24s] it's not somebody else's job.
[4835.24s - 4840.59s] And I would say learning how to allow in
[4840.59s - 4843.27s] other people's expression of love
[4843.27s - 4845.73s] is a huge opportunity for you,
[4845.77s - 4849.79s] whether it's your friends, whether it's your parents,
[4849.79s - 4853.61s] whether it's your kids, your partner, everybody.
[4853.61s - 4855.21s] Like, how do you do that?
[4855.21s - 4858.01s] Especially if you've been a first class asshole like me.
[4858.01s - 4859.57s] Me too, me too.
[4859.57s - 4861.09s] You didn't do it this way.
[4861.09s - 4863.93s] And I thought, nobody texted me on the thing
[4863.93s - 4865.17s] and nobody checked in.
[4865.17s - 4868.49s] We're so focused on what's not happening
[4868.49s - 4871.41s] that you're blocking what actually is.
[4871.41s - 4874.49s] And then you just keep preventing it
[4874.53s - 4879.84s] from being an experience it's available to you right now.
[4879.84s - 4880.76s] Thank you for sharing that.
[4880.76s - 4882.32s] And by the way, I feel the same way too.
[4882.32s - 4885.04s] It took me so many years of unpacking
[4885.04s - 4888.36s] to understand why I was so fixated.
[4888.36s - 4891.40s] But the way I think about it is
[4891.40s - 4896.04s] the person that texts you when they don't want anything.
[4896.04s - 4898.24s] Don't forget that person.
[4898.24s - 4901.98s] The person who calls you when they don't need anything.
[4901.98s - 4904.10s] Don't forget that person.
[4904.14s - 4909.20s] The person who comes over and swings by just to chat,
[4909.36s - 4911.11s] even when you're busy.
[4911.11s - 4913.13s] Don't forget that person.
[4913.13s - 4917.33s] The person who walks in and remembered
[4917.33s - 4919.29s] that you had something happening at work
[4919.29s - 4920.65s] or something happening in your home
[4920.65s - 4922.65s] or something happening in your life.
[4922.65s - 4924.53s] Don't forget that person.
[4924.53s - 4929.53s] We do it by starting to recognize those people in our life
[4930.66s - 4935.24s] that are not big and crazy, but they're consistent.
[4935.24s - 4937.12s] The consistent people in our life
[4937.12s - 4939.32s] are the people that are forgotten.
[4939.32s - 4941.48s] The people who've become like furniture.
[4941.48s - 4943.60s] The people who've become so familiar.
[4943.60s - 4944.44s] But guess what?
[4944.44s - 4945.92s] They were the people that texted you
[4945.92s - 4946.96s] when they needed nothing.
[4946.96s - 4949.28s] They're the people that called you when they wanted nothing.
[4949.28s - 4950.80s] They're the people that checked in with you
[4950.80s - 4953.71s] with no transaction required.
[4953.71s - 4955.47s] Take a moment to just think of that person
[4955.47s - 4958.19s] and messes them now and don't ask for anything.
[4958.19s - 4959.66s] Just tell them.
[4959.66s - 4961.22s] Tell them how you feel.
[4961.22s - 4962.30s] Messes them and say,
[4962.30s - 4965.30s] thank you so much for showing up for me
[4965.30s - 4967.06s] when you didn't want anything in return.
[4967.06s - 4970.02s] Thank you so much for checking in with me
[4970.02s - 4971.94s] when you got nothing out of it.
[4971.94s - 4973.74s] Acknowledge them for that
[4973.74s - 4975.74s] because we have to start noticing it.
[4975.74s - 4977.02s] We have to start noticing it.
[4977.02s - 4978.42s] It's so easy.
[4978.42s - 4980.58s] And this is why I have this habit
[4980.58s - 4984.02s] that whenever I think of someone, I send them a message.
[4984.02s - 4986.86s] Whatever my thought may be, I'll send them a message.
[4986.86s - 4988.42s] And the message will just say,
[4988.42s - 4992.05s] thinking of you, Mel, sending you lots of love.
[4992.05s - 4994.01s] And I do it all the time.
[4994.01s - 4996.81s] The amount of times in the last month
[4996.81s - 4999.69s] that that person has responded to me immediately
[4999.69s - 5002.29s] and said, I was just talking about you.
[5002.29s - 5004.53s] I was just thinking about you.
[5004.53s - 5007.77s] Oh my gosh, I was just sharing something you put online
[5007.77s - 5010.01s] or shared on Instagram or whatever it may have been.
[5010.01s - 5011.45s] The amount of times that's happened
[5011.45s - 5014.08s] is truly blowing my mind.
[5014.12s - 5016.80s] And I've realized because you know
[5016.80s - 5019.84s] we all have this sense, you and I, all of us,
[5019.84s - 5021.56s] everyone who's listening and watching right now
[5021.56s - 5025.30s] has this intuition when someone needs us.
[5025.30s - 5026.82s] But we're scared.
[5026.82s - 5029.66s] We're scared to message with no reason.
[5029.66s - 5031.38s] We're scared we might be disrupting someone
[5031.38s - 5032.54s] or they're too busy.
[5032.54s - 5035.22s] We're scared, but no, no, no, that's what that person wants.
[5035.22s - 5038.06s] That person wants you to just send love when they're busy.
[5038.06s - 5040.58s] That person wants you to say hello
[5040.58s - 5041.74s] when they're having a crazy day
[5041.74s - 5043.82s] because guess what, you're the only person doing that.
[5043.86s - 5045.10s] Everyone else is asking for something
[5045.10s - 5047.75s] or wants something from them.
[5047.75s - 5048.91s] The best time to message someone
[5048.91s - 5050.51s] is when you don't want anything.
[5050.51s - 5052.51s] You actually talk about this a lot online,
[5052.51s - 5053.91s] the power of calling somebody,
[5053.91s - 5055.47s] the power of texting somebody
[5055.47s - 5058.35s] and how much we underestimate this small action.
[5058.35s - 5062.88s] And you also said that we have this amazing sense
[5062.88s - 5065.80s] to sense when somebody needs you.
[5065.80s - 5070.50s] And what I would ask us all to consider
[5070.50s - 5074.50s] is that the people that you care about always need you.
[5074.50s - 5079.95s] And that check-in is you doing something that we all need,
[5080.83s - 5084.79s] which is this small act of loving somebody
[5084.79s - 5088.67s] and seeing them and just saying, I have you in mind.
[5088.67s - 5092.39s] One of the reasons why I always tell the person
[5092.39s - 5093.59s] who's listening that I love them
[5093.59s - 5097.15s] is because I think we just vastly inflate
[5097.15s - 5098.83s] what that word actually means.
[5098.83s - 5102.83s] And to me, when you look at the word love, it's two things.
[5102.87s - 5105.47s] You admire something in someone else,
[5105.47s - 5109.51s] some quality, some characteristics, something about them.
[5109.51s - 5111.87s] And you consider them, you have them in mind.
[5111.87s - 5115.75s] And if you admire somebody, something about their values,
[5115.75s - 5117.27s] something about how they show up in life,
[5117.27s - 5120.83s] something about who they are, what they mean to you,
[5120.83s - 5125.07s] and you have them in mind to your point, sending a text.
[5125.07s - 5126.35s] Just to say, I was just thinking about,
[5126.35s - 5129.63s] you're making somebody a cup of coffee with the cashew milk
[5129.63s - 5131.39s] because that's what they care about.
[5131.39s - 5132.51s] That's actually an act of love.
[5132.55s - 5134.10s] It is.
[5134.10s - 5138.38s] And if we go all the way back to the janitors in the hospital
[5138.38s - 5140.22s] who say that they are healers
[5140.22s - 5145.22s] because they believe that having a clean space
[5145.50s - 5148.50s] for families to gather, for people to heal
[5148.50s - 5153.58s] is a sacred thing to do for the healing process,
[5153.58s - 5158.09s] then you are demonstrating an act of love.
[5158.09s - 5159.57s] How do you think about love?
[5159.57s - 5160.41s] How do I think about love?
[5160.41s - 5162.57s] Such a beautiful and big question.
[5162.57s - 5166.45s] Because I feel like we're coming out of this conversation
[5166.45s - 5168.61s] about how we block it
[5168.61s - 5171.89s] because we're expecting it to be expressed in a certain way
[5171.89s - 5174.53s] and that it is all around you.
[5174.53s - 5179.53s] And you're a person in my life that you show up that way.
[5179.93s - 5184.54s] I mean, there's what you do, which is your job.
[5184.54s - 5189.14s] And the things that you are doing
[5189.18s - 5194.71s] that is in service of the world, but it's not who you are.
[5194.71s - 5196.99s] And my experience of you is somebody
[5196.99s - 5199.87s] who is the expression of love.
[5199.87s - 5200.71s] Thank you.
[5200.71s - 5201.55s] You're so sweet.
[5201.55s - 5202.55s] That touches my heart.
[5207.80s - 5209.00s] I think what you just said,
[5209.00s - 5212.30s] there's even more interesting about blocking love.
[5212.30s - 5218.97s] If you still see your mom calling, that's a blessing.
[5219.33s - 5222.94s] If you still see your dad's name on your phone,
[5222.94s - 5227.17s] sending you a text, that's a blessing.
[5227.21s - 5228.73s] 10 years from now,
[5228.73s - 5232.49s] you're not gonna remember the meeting you were in.
[5232.49s - 5234.09s] 20 years from now,
[5234.09s - 5238.39s] you're not gonna remember the task you were doing.
[5238.39s - 5240.43s] That's how we block love.
[5240.43s - 5242.31s] We block love because when it's coming in,
[5242.31s - 5246.08s] when it's coming freely, when it's coming unlimitedly,
[5246.08s - 5248.12s] we don't know how to hold on to it.
[5248.12s - 5251.76s] There's this beautiful poem from India
[5251.76s - 5257.06s] that says, when God wants to give us something,
[5257.06s - 5260.90s] how much can these two little hands hold on to?
[5260.90s - 5264.33s] And when things are taken away from us,
[5264.33s - 5267.60s] how much can these two little hands hold on to?
[5267.60s - 5272.60s] And it's this beautiful idea of God's ever-flowing love
[5273.86s - 5275.58s] that's unlimitedly there.
[5275.58s - 5278.63s] And we can just try catch and hold whatever we can.
[5278.63s - 5282.46s] And at the same time in, when something's going away,
[5282.46s - 5284.02s] there's an insignificance that we have
[5284.02s - 5286.67s] where we can't hold on to it anymore.
[5286.67s - 5288.38s] So what do we do?
[5288.38s - 5290.14s] We pick up the call.
[5290.14s - 5291.71s] We return it.
[5291.71s - 5293.80s] We message back.
[5293.80s - 5295.20s] We don't block it by saying,
[5295.20s - 5297.80s] oh, they just keep connecting.
[5297.80s - 5299.72s] Oh, that person just keeps calling.
[5299.72s - 5303.00s] Oh, that person just, the amount of people
[5303.00s - 5306.87s] that are blocking love because they're thinking
[5306.87s - 5309.95s] that person's needy or that person's desperate
[5309.95s - 5314.03s] or that person's not cool enough to be my friend
[5314.03s - 5317.67s] or that person's not interesting enough to be my friend.
[5317.67s - 5321.71s] I know so many people today that are leaving friendships
[5321.71s - 5323.39s] and relationships behind
[5323.39s - 5324.83s] because the person's not cool enough,
[5324.83s - 5328.27s] smart enough, talented enough, whatever it is.
[5328.27s - 5329.55s] Because when someone shows
[5329.55s - 5331.75s] and wears their heart on their sleeve,
[5331.75s - 5334.12s] we see that as a weakness.
[5334.12s - 5338.08s] We believe that love is chasing someone
[5338.08s - 5341.68s] rather than wanting someone who never wants to leave.
[5341.68s - 5346.68s] We would rather chase, pursue and court someone
[5347.20s - 5350.36s] because we believe that love has to be earned
[5350.40s - 5352.84s] rather than receive it freely
[5352.84s - 5355.00s] from all of these people around us
[5355.00s - 5357.52s] who are giving it to us unlimitedly
[5357.52s - 5362.20s] because we think that love is valuable if it's rare.
[5362.20s - 5364.28s] We believe that love is valuable
[5364.28s - 5366.36s] if it's given in small doses.
[5366.36s - 5368.32s] If someone's holding it back a little,
[5368.32s - 5371.56s] it feels like power and that feels like love to us.
[5371.56s - 5373.60s] But that's not love, it's control.
[5373.60s - 5376.20s] That's not love, it's manipulation.
[5376.20s - 5378.76s] That's not a partnership, it's ownership.
[5378.80s - 5381.16s] So if you're looking for a relationship,
[5381.16s - 5383.44s] love should just flow freely.
[5383.44s - 5385.44s] Love is not measured, it's not calculated,
[5385.44s - 5388.56s] it's not counted, it's not some algorithm,
[5388.56s - 5391.36s] it's not a number, it's completely
[5391.36s - 5393.88s] a free flowing energetic force.
[5393.88s - 5396.44s] And it is in your life, it is flowing within you,
[5396.44s - 5400.76s] you are made of it, you are actually made of it
[5400.76s - 5402.64s] and it is flowing freely within you too,
[5402.64s - 5406.17s] you are all times, it's why you are alive.
[5406.17s - 5407.93s] But if you block it,
[5407.97s - 5409.37s] it's like when the sun's out
[5409.37s - 5411.37s] and you turn the blinds down.
[5411.37s - 5414.73s] The sun is freely showering its rays
[5414.73s - 5416.85s] onto every single home.
[5416.85s - 5418.61s] The sun does not discriminate,
[5418.61s - 5421.97s] the sun will freely give its sun to everyone.
[5421.97s - 5426.46s] But if you put the shades down, you're blocking it.
[5426.46s - 5427.30s] Don't do that.
[5428.29s - 5431.85s] There's so many people that feel isolated and lonely, Jay.
[5433.21s - 5435.33s] If somebody's listening and they're like,
[5435.37s - 5437.17s] the shades are down, Jay.
[5437.17s - 5440.32s] And there aren't people in my life.
[5440.32s - 5441.96s] What is one thing somebody can do
[5441.96s - 5444.48s] that recognizes that the shades are drawn
[5444.48s - 5446.30s] for whatever reason?
[5446.30s - 5449.66s] How do you start to crank it back up
[5449.66s - 5453.14s] and let all of that that is available to you?
[5453.14s - 5458.14s] Friendship, love, connection, possibility, hope, all of it.
[5458.14s - 5460.58s] What's one thing that somebody could do?
[5460.58s - 5464.14s] Be that person, be the person to text someone love.
[5464.18s - 5467.14s] Be the person to call in and check in on someone,
[5467.14s - 5468.78s] even if they don't check in on you.
[5468.78s - 5471.14s] Be the person who goes and helps someone
[5471.14s - 5473.26s] with their groceries because they need it.
[5473.26s - 5476.42s] Be the person who goes and gives love to others
[5476.42s - 5478.06s] even if they're not feeling it back
[5478.06s - 5480.98s] because that's the beautiful thing about love.
[5480.98s - 5484.42s] Love is not only experienced in receiving,
[5484.42s - 5485.90s] it's experienced in giving.
[5485.90s - 5488.50s] That's the most phenomenal thing about love
[5488.50s - 5492.10s] is that when you're giving someone something special,
[5492.14s - 5494.54s] you feel love just as much as they do.
[5494.54s - 5496.46s] Sometimes we feel it even more
[5496.46s - 5498.74s] than when we're receiving something, right?
[5498.74s - 5501.30s] There's this feeling of when you've done something
[5501.30s - 5504.30s] for someone you love, there's a joy in it.
[5504.30s - 5506.42s] You think about it, you said you love gardening.
[5506.42s - 5509.95s] Gardening is the best analogy for this.
[5509.95s - 5512.83s] There is no rose in the world
[5512.83s - 5515.99s] that grows the day you plant the seed.
[5515.99s - 5518.23s] There is no plant in the world
[5518.23s - 5521.66s] that grows the day you plant the seed.
[5521.66s - 5525.90s] It takes months, sometimes even years
[5525.90s - 5530.26s] for a tree to have a beautiful fruit or a beautiful flower.
[5530.26s - 5532.85s] And it takes a particular season.
[5532.85s - 5534.41s] Now, if you planted that seed
[5534.41s - 5537.15s] and said, why don't I have a fruit today?
[5537.15s - 5538.21s] It wouldn't make sense.
[5538.21s - 5540.03s] I'd look at you like you're crazy.
[5540.03s - 5541.71s] But that's what we do in love.
[5541.71s - 5544.43s] We plant the seed today and we want the fruit,
[5544.43s - 5548.10s] the flower and the shade today.
[5548.10s - 5552.63s] And the deepest form of love is something that Emerson said,
[5552.67s - 5557.47s] plant trees under whose shade you do not plan to sit.
[5557.47s - 5559.12s] And that's what you do.
[5559.12s - 5561.64s] You're helping so many people that you probably
[5561.64s - 5563.14s] don't even know.
[5563.14s - 5565.34s] Hopefully they'll get to meet you one day and tell you,
[5565.34s - 5567.18s] Mal, I really hope that you get to hear it.
[5567.18s - 5569.26s] But there'll be so many people who never do.
[5569.26s - 5570.38s] But you're not doing it for that.
[5570.38s - 5572.18s] You're doing it because you're happy
[5572.18s - 5574.74s] for trees to just exist so that other people
[5574.74s - 5577.70s] can get fruits and flowers and shade.
[5577.70s - 5580.86s] So let's not sit here and plant the seed today
[5580.86s - 5583.56s] and expect to eat the fruit today.
[5583.56s - 5585.60s] It doesn't work that way.
[5585.60s - 5587.76s] Plant the seed and keep planting the seeds.
[5587.76s - 5591.02s] And you will find decades from now,
[5591.02s - 5593.50s] there'll be someone who comes to you 25 years from now
[5593.50s - 5595.70s] and says, you did this one thing.
[5595.70s - 5597.74s] I love calling my teachers.
[5597.74s - 5598.88s] I love calling old teachers.
[5598.88s - 5601.22s] I'm really good friends with all the schools I went to.
[5601.22s - 5603.62s] I love calling professors, teachers,
[5603.62s - 5605.42s] talking about them in interviews,
[5605.42s - 5607.10s] making them feel really embarrassed
[5607.10s - 5608.90s] and just saying how much they changed my life
[5608.90s - 5610.42s] and how much I love them.
[5610.42s - 5613.46s] Because I don't think they knew that then.
[5613.46s - 5616.94s] At that time, I was just a teenager who had teenage issues
[5616.94s - 5619.50s] and didn't care about teachers and probably, you know,
[5619.50s - 5620.92s] whatever, I was just a kid.
[5620.92s - 5623.30s] Now when I look back, I'm like, that teacher changed my life.
[5623.30s - 5624.94s] Let me tell them.
[5624.94s - 5628.49s] And that's a seed that they planted all those years ago.
[5628.49s - 5629.45s] So live for that.
[5629.45s - 5630.61s] You know, let's live for that.
[5630.61s - 5634.03s] Let's not live for this instant immediate love.
[5634.03s - 5636.19s] Who is a teacher from when you were little?
[5636.19s - 5637.43s] Oh gosh, there's a couple.
[5637.43s - 5639.79s] So there's two that come to mind
[5639.79s - 5640.87s] as soon as you say that.
[5640.87s - 5644.63s] One is Mr. Buckeridge, who was my art teacher.
[5644.63s - 5647.19s] And I loved art at school.
[5647.19s - 5649.51s] And actually, when I was 11 years old,
[5649.51s - 5651.31s] my favorite subject was math
[5651.31s - 5653.39s] and my least favorite subject was art.
[5653.39s - 5655.07s] And when I went to high school,
[5655.07s - 5656.51s] my favorite subject was art
[5656.51s - 5658.31s] and my least favorite subject was math.
[5658.31s - 5660.39s] And art I fell in love with because of this teacher.
[5660.39s - 5662.11s] There was something beautiful he taught me.
[5662.11s - 5664.46s] And I really owe this to him.
[5664.46s - 5667.22s] Every time I presented a piece of work,
[5667.22s - 5670.24s] he'd say to me, why did you do it?
[5670.24s - 5672.56s] And at that time I didn't have an answer.
[5672.56s - 5674.20s] I just did it because it looked good.
[5674.20s - 5675.36s] It looked cool.
[5675.36s - 5677.16s] My answer was that basic.
[5677.16s - 5678.44s] Yeah, they look good together.
[5678.44s - 5679.76s] The colors match.
[5679.76s - 5680.60s] Oh, this looks cool.
[5680.60s - 5682.00s] It looks trendy.
[5682.00s - 5683.40s] And he'd never be satisfied with that.
[5683.40s - 5685.08s] He'd say, why did you do it?
[5685.08s - 5686.36s] And he kept asking me that.
[5686.36s - 5688.12s] And in the beginning, it would annoy me.
[5688.12s - 5689.44s] It would annoy me so much.
[5689.44s - 5691.44s] It'd be like, God, come on, it looks good.
[5691.44s - 5692.28s] Who cares?
[5692.28s - 5693.12s] Just give me an A.
[5693.12s - 5693.96s] Like, you like the look of it.
[5693.96s - 5695.48s] He loved how it looked.
[5695.48s - 5697.64s] But he wouldn't, he wasn't satisfied with that.
[5697.64s - 5699.13s] He'd say, why?
[5699.17s - 5702.69s] I believe he's the reason I became such an intentional person.
[5702.69s - 5707.85s] Because he didn't allow me to place one color or dot or shape
[5707.85s - 5710.97s] next to something else if I could not explain why.
[5710.97s - 5713.85s] So today, if you come to my home, you come to my space,
[5713.85s - 5717.77s] everything from the moment I wake up to what I see,
[5717.77s - 5720.01s] to which book is by my bedside,
[5720.01s - 5722.61s] to what quote is next to my work desk,
[5722.61s - 5725.93s] everything is meticulously intentionally planned out
[5725.93s - 5728.25s] because he never allowed me space
[5728.29s - 5731.00s] to just do something because it looked good.
[5731.00s - 5733.40s] And that is the biggest gift he's given me
[5733.40s - 5735.96s] because my life is so intentional.
[5735.96s - 5736.80s] And he gave me that.
[5736.80s - 5737.64s] He was an art teacher.
[5737.64s - 5741.16s] I didn't know that at 11 to 18 when he was my teacher,
[5741.16s - 5743.16s] but I look back and I know it now.
[5743.16s - 5744.00s] Oh my God.
[5744.00s - 5746.04s] You're making me think of a teacher
[5746.04s - 5748.52s] that I wish was still with us.
[5748.52s - 5752.72s] He was my middle school and high school math teacher.
[5752.72s - 5754.56s] I loved math.
[5754.56s - 5757.56s] Mr. Cor, Glenn Cor, he was a military guy.
[5757.56s - 5759.40s] So we had a crew cut and he always wore those
[5759.40s - 5762.00s] like short sleeve collared shirts
[5762.00s - 5764.36s] and he had the protector and the glasses
[5764.36s - 5765.28s] and the whole thing.
[5765.28s - 5767.44s] And God did I love math.
[5767.44s - 5770.20s] And he would always call people up
[5770.20s - 5772.44s] to solve problems on the chalkboard.
[5772.44s - 5777.44s] And I can feel him like handing the chalk to me, right?
[5777.44s - 5779.20s] So you would like solve the chalk things
[5779.20s - 5780.48s] and then he'd coach it through it.
[5780.48s - 5781.84s] And then we'd talk about the problems,
[5781.84s - 5784.00s] but he had this thing that he would do
[5784.04s - 5787.12s] where if somebody started to struggle
[5787.12s - 5789.56s] or get frustrated or feel really stupid,
[5789.56s - 5793.99s] he would turn to the class and say, what do I always say?
[5793.99s - 5798.75s] And we would all recite back perseverance wins.
[5798.75s - 5800.15s] And he would take his chalk
[5800.15s - 5804.39s] and he would write in all caps, perseverance wins.
[5804.39s - 5805.59s] And they would underline it.
[5805.59s - 5808.47s] And then we'd be like exclamation, exclamation.
[5808.47s - 5810.47s] And it's true.
[5810.47s - 5812.83s] It like seeped into my pores.
[5812.83s - 5816.16s] And I think more than anything else
[5816.16s - 5819.80s] that I yes planted seeds,
[5819.80s - 5823.60s] but just kept going.
[5823.60s - 5828.60s] That perseverance wins part of just don't quit.
[5829.00s - 5831.16s] Like that's part of it is just your,
[5831.16s - 5835.89s] if you open yourself up to learning,
[5835.89s - 5839.45s] to experimenting, to all of the abundance
[5839.45s - 5843.45s] that is available to you out there, eventually it comes.
[5843.49s - 5844.41s] I love that.
[5844.41s - 5845.25s] I love that.
[5845.25s - 5846.17s] And everyone should do that.
[5846.17s - 5848.93s] Everyone should reach out to a teacher if they can,
[5848.93s - 5850.41s] if that person's still alive.
[5850.41s - 5852.05s] And just tell them, send them an email,
[5852.05s - 5855.33s] drop them a Facebook message, DM or whatever access,
[5855.33s - 5856.53s] call the school if you have to.
[5856.53s - 5860.05s] Like it will just, it creates that energy in our life
[5860.05s - 5863.05s] of gratitude and valuing people and appreciation.
[5863.05s - 5864.21s] And it will come back.
[5864.21s - 5865.37s] I promise you will come back.
[5865.37s - 5866.61s] You could share this episode,
[5866.61s - 5869.29s] this conversation with people that you care about
[5869.29s - 5873.05s] and tell them how much this conversation
[5873.05s - 5875.37s] made you think of them
[5875.37s - 5877.77s] and realize how much you love them.
[5877.77s - 5879.37s] Like what a beautiful thing.
[5879.37s - 5881.21s] You know another beautiful thing, Jay,
[5881.21s - 5884.09s] is that I know that as you're listening
[5884.09s - 5886.13s] and as you've spent all this time together
[5886.13s - 5887.37s] with Jay and I today,
[5887.37s - 5890.53s] you're thinking, God, I wish I could meet Jay.
[5890.53s - 5892.21s] And you're going on tour.
[5892.21s - 5894.13s] I am so excited.
[5894.13s - 5894.97s] Tell me about it.
[5894.97s - 5896.05s] I have never ever.
[5896.05s - 5897.93s] So I went on a world tour two years ago.
[5897.93s - 5898.77s] But that was for a book.
[5898.77s - 5899.61s] But that was for a book.
[5899.61s - 5900.45s] Right.
[5900.57s - 5903.49s] The first time ever
[5903.49s - 5907.97s] that we're taking the on purpose podcast on tour.
[5907.97s - 5910.61s] And I promise you the insights that we're going to share,
[5910.61s - 5912.85s] the wisdom that's going to be shared on this tour
[5912.85s - 5916.73s] has not been shared in any book on any podcast.
[5916.73s - 5918.25s] It's so fresh.
[5918.25s - 5919.21s] And you're going to get to see,
[5919.21s - 5921.33s] the best part about it is you're going to get to see me
[5921.33s - 5925.37s] and my friends, people that I know deeply on stage,
[5925.37s - 5929.68s] 15 guests in 15 cities, different guests,
[5929.68s - 5931.76s] just have a real conversation like this.
[5931.76s - 5936.68s] And the best part for your audience is you have kindly agreed
[5936.68s - 5939.60s] in the craziest schedule of all time
[5939.60s - 5942.40s] to be my guest in Boston.
[5942.40s - 5943.24s] That's right.
[5943.24s - 5944.72s] Which we're at right now.
[5944.72s - 5945.56s] Yes.
[5945.56s - 5947.36s] The Wang Theater, you better get tickets
[5947.36s - 5948.60s] because they're going to be gone.
[5948.60s - 5949.84s] Like, they're probably already gone
[5949.84s - 5950.80s] by the time you hear this.
[5950.80s - 5951.80s] Yeah, it's amazing.
[5951.80s - 5954.44s] So Jayshetty.me forward slash tour.
[5954.44s - 5958.28s] We're doing 15 cities across North America to start.
[5958.28s - 5959.44s] You're so excited about it.
[5960.24s - 5966.73s] Because, Mel, you know, having this incredible podcast,
[5966.73s - 5971.77s] there's an intimacy that you have with your listeners
[5971.77s - 5974.41s] because we know that everyone who's listening right now
[5974.41s - 5979.88s] listens every day, every week, all year round.
[5979.88s - 5983.93s] The connection I feel to my on-purpose community
[5983.93s - 5987.94s] is so deep because it's all year round.
[5987.94s - 5990.62s] It's not the same as anything else.
[5990.70s - 5995.97s] We're in people's ears every single day, every single week.
[5995.97s - 5998.85s] Now imagine this person's usually on a hike.
[5998.85s - 6000.45s] All of you that are listening, you're on a hike,
[6000.45s - 6003.53s] you're cooking, you're in the car commuting to work,
[6003.53s - 6005.17s] you're maybe at work, you're at the gym,
[6005.17s - 6007.13s] you're walking your dog.
[6007.13s - 6011.81s] Now we get to be in the same place at the same time
[6011.81s - 6013.13s] in person.
[6013.13s - 6017.17s] And on top of that, you're now surrounded by people
[6017.17s - 6018.89s] who do the same thing as you.
[6018.89s - 6022.33s] So my favorite thing is not even just what we're gonna do
[6022.33s - 6024.69s] on stage, it's the fact that people are gonna walk out
[6024.69s - 6026.21s] there as friends.
[6026.21s - 6029.13s] People are gonna walk out there connected to people
[6029.13s - 6030.49s] that they've maybe never met.
[6030.49s - 6031.57s] I think people are gonna walk out there
[6031.57s - 6033.97s] with a future wife or husband or partner
[6033.97s - 6036.53s] because that person is doing the same thing you're doing.
[6036.53s - 6041.23s] The collective consciousness of a space like that
[6041.23s - 6042.43s] is unheard of.
[6042.43s - 6046.23s] There's very few places that people gather today
[6046.27s - 6050.55s] with the same exact intention in person.
[6050.55s - 6053.27s] It used to be there, it doesn't exist anymore.
[6053.27s - 6054.75s] You go to a coffee shop, everyone's there
[6054.75s - 6055.83s] for different reasons.
[6055.83s - 6058.35s] Someone's working, someone's wasting some time,
[6058.35s - 6060.95s] someone's starting their day, someone's ending their day.
[6060.95s - 6063.51s] There's not a collective consciousness.
[6063.51s - 6065.47s] You go to an office, some people working from home,
[6065.47s - 6066.75s] some people work from there,
[6066.75s - 6068.11s] some people are there to pay the bills,
[6068.11s - 6070.27s] some people are there because they're excited.
[6070.27s - 6072.49s] Different consciousness.
[6072.49s - 6075.09s] Everyone who listens to the Mel Robbins podcast
[6075.09s - 6079.25s] or to on purpose is committed to learning,
[6079.25s - 6082.33s] listening and growing and committed
[6082.33s - 6085.56s] to health, happiness and healing.
[6085.56s - 6088.90s] The energy in that room, there's no other place
[6088.90s - 6090.70s] you can go to that feels that way.
[6090.70s - 6092.79s] It doesn't exist.
[6092.79s - 6093.95s] It's really, really special.
[6093.95s - 6095.03s] That's why I'm so excited
[6095.03s - 6096.83s] because collective consciousness
[6096.83s - 6098.79s] doesn't work like that anymore.
[6098.79s - 6100.99s] You know, in the past, there's something beautiful
[6100.99s - 6102.83s] that I'm writing about for my next book.
[6102.83s - 6105.31s] It's called The Third Space Theory.
[6105.35s - 6111.67s] This idea that a few decades ago,
[6111.67s - 6115.70s] we all had three spaces that we lived in.
[6115.70s - 6121.22s] One was home, one was work and one was church.
[6121.22s - 6123.74s] There was a place that you called home
[6123.74s - 6125.82s] where you felt very safe and comfortable.
[6125.82s - 6128.30s] There was a place that you called work
[6128.30s - 6130.38s] which was very productive and effective.
[6130.38s - 6133.58s] And then there was a place that gave you the vision
[6133.58s - 6136.50s] to reflect back on who you were at home
[6136.50s - 6137.90s] and who you were at work
[6137.90s - 6139.94s] and how you could be better.
[6139.94s - 6144.54s] Slowly as time went on, that third space disappeared.
[6144.54s - 6147.58s] So we had home and we had work
[6147.58s - 6151.02s] because of the pandemic, work disappeared.
[6151.02s - 6153.04s] So now we only have home.
[6153.04s - 6155.64s] So at home, we eat where we're meant to sleep.
[6155.64s - 6157.56s] We sleep where we're meant to work
[6157.56s - 6159.60s] and we work where we're meant to eat.
[6159.60s - 6163.36s] The energy of home has become so complicated
[6163.36s - 6166.64s] that we don't know how to find a productive energy,
[6166.64s - 6168.56s] how to find a connected energy,
[6168.56s - 6171.36s] how to find a safe, calm energy.
[6171.36s - 6173.26s] We've lost that.
[6173.26s - 6175.58s] Podcasts are the new third space.
[6175.58s - 6177.38s] That's where people are gathering.
[6177.38s - 6179.26s] But what if we can turn that into a place,
[6179.26s - 6181.86s] a physical space where you can gather,
[6181.86s - 6183.70s] where people come to listen, learn,
[6183.70s - 6185.22s] to reflect back on their life,
[6185.22s - 6187.86s] to wanna be better, to support each other.
[6187.86s - 6190.58s] And so there's such a need for us to do these things.
[6190.58s - 6192.94s] And I'm so glad you're going on tour.
[6192.94s - 6194.34s] People can come and see you as well.
[6194.34s - 6197.59s] It's just, it's so needed right now.
[6197.59s - 6200.03s] I love how you just laid that out.
[6200.03s - 6201.19s] It's true.
[6201.19s - 6202.75s] It's like the three legs of the stool,
[6202.75s - 6203.79s] two of them are gone.
[6203.79s - 6205.75s] It's why everybody's so wobbly
[6205.75s - 6207.51s] and trying to find their balance.
[6207.51s - 6212.51s] And I'm also excited because when you have these conversations
[6212.51s - 6216.23s] I always think about that I'm taking a walk
[6216.23s - 6218.15s] with you as you're listening.
[6218.15s - 6222.59s] And that today we have invited my dear friend Jay Shetty
[6222.59s - 6227.07s] on this metaphorical walk together on the road of life.
[6227.07s - 6228.87s] And I was curious, Jay,
[6228.87s - 6231.63s] you've shared so much you've poured into us
[6231.63s - 6234.79s] with such just grace and wisdom.
[6234.79s - 6240.02s] And I knew this was going to be extraordinary.
[6242.79s - 6248.88s] I am just blown away by the impact that this will make
[6251.96s - 6254.00s] in the person's life who's listening,
[6254.00s - 6255.64s] the impact it's made in my life,
[6255.68s - 6259.20s] how it has truly brought us closer.
[6260.60s - 6265.90s] I'm so excited for all the things that you're working on.
[6265.90s - 6268.34s] If there was one thing that you want
[6268.34s - 6271.14s] the person who's listening to do,
[6272.38s - 6275.74s] just one thing, the most important thing
[6275.74s - 6280.50s] to really focus on coming out of just how generous
[6280.50s - 6282.62s] you have been with all of us.
[6284.57s - 6288.71s] What is the one thing today?
[6288.71s - 6293.58s] The one thing is if you're feeling stuck,
[6293.58s - 6297.96s] I want you to ask yourself one question.
[6297.96s - 6302.74s] Life can either be a school, a hospital,
[6302.74s - 6306.12s] a movie or a mountain.
[6306.12s - 6310.68s] Ask yourself, if life feels like a school right now
[6310.68s - 6312.75s] what do I need to learn?
[6312.75s - 6315.51s] Because the same lessons will keep repeating
[6315.51s - 6317.19s] until we learn them.
[6317.19s - 6320.07s] If you're feeling like you're caught in a spiral
[6320.07s - 6322.63s] of the same thing after the same thing
[6322.63s - 6325.42s] life is trying to teach you something,
[6325.42s - 6328.53s] go to the school of life.
[6328.53s - 6331.04s] Sometimes life feels like a hospital.
[6331.04s - 6332.79s] There's something to heal.
[6332.79s - 6337.13s] If you feel in pain, if you feel held back,
[6337.13s - 6339.17s] if you feel like you're not strong enough yet
[6339.17s - 6341.85s] to go out there and go after something,
[6341.85s - 6345.91s] ask yourself, what do I need to heal and start healing?
[6345.91s - 6347.75s] Sometimes life feels like a movie.
[6347.75s - 6350.95s] Everything's kind of going in a great direction.
[6350.95s - 6354.27s] Pause and ask yourself, what do I need to experience?
[6354.27s - 6357.77s] Because this experience will also dissipate and disappear.
[6357.77s - 6360.35s] Let me really experience it.
[6360.35s - 6363.59s] And finally, for those who are already on their path,
[6363.59s - 6365.91s] life can feel like a mountain.
[6365.91s - 6368.47s] Ask yourself, what do I need to climb?
[6368.47s - 6371.43s] What skill do I need to learn to climb better?
[6371.43s - 6374.03s] You're stuck because you haven't figured out
[6374.03s - 6378.91s] whether life is a school, a hospital, a movie or a mountain.
[6378.91s - 6381.43s] And as soon as you see the patterns,
[6381.43s - 6384.39s] are you being questioned again and again to learn something?
[6384.39s - 6385.99s] Are you just feeling so much pain
[6385.99s - 6389.28s] that you can't even bear the burden to move forward?
[6389.28s - 6390.96s] Then it's all about healing.
[6390.96s - 6392.96s] Are you living at the top of the world?
[6392.96s - 6396.66s] But time feels like it's moving too fast.
[6396.66s - 6398.78s] Immersing that experience.
[6398.78s - 6400.78s] And if you're building right now,
[6400.78s - 6404.24s] build that skill so you can climb higher and faster.
[6405.24s - 6407.36s] You know, as you're listening,
[6407.36s - 6410.39s] I want to point out something that just happened.
[6410.39s - 6413.59s] You probably saw it if you're watching on YouTube.
[6413.63s - 6416.35s] As Jay just shared that with you,
[6416.35s - 6419.55s] what has been a wildly dreary and ugly day
[6419.55s - 6421.79s] here in Boston shifted.
[6421.79s - 6425.75s] And sunlight came streaming in
[6425.75s - 6430.19s] and lit you up like a spotlight from above.
[6430.19s - 6431.69s] Did you feel that?
[6431.69s - 6435.30s] You know what? You're more present than I am.
[6435.30s - 6436.54s] I was so locked in.
[6436.54s - 6438.26s] I didn't feel it until you said it.
[6438.26s - 6440.54s] And I looked over and I'm like, wow.
[6440.54s - 6442.06s] It shows how present you are.
[6442.06s - 6443.62s] That's beautiful. I love that.
[6443.62s - 6444.82s] Well, I took the...
[6444.82s - 6448.02s] I was hanging on every word and I realized I'm in the movie.
[6448.02s - 6451.66s] And I really want to be present and experience it.
[6451.66s - 6455.51s] Jay Shetty, what are your parting words, my friend?
[6455.51s - 6458.61s] My parting words, I'm so grateful to you, Mao.
[6458.61s - 6460.21s] You know, I'm so grateful to you
[6460.21s - 6463.90s] because you've just done this for so many years
[6463.90s - 6468.82s] and given your heart and you are receiving
[6468.82s - 6470.82s] everything that you deserve.
[6470.82s - 6473.98s] Everything that you're getting you deserve so deeply.
[6473.98s - 6479.58s] And it is so beautiful to witness your friends being honored
[6479.58s - 6481.58s] and being adored and being loved
[6481.58s - 6486.38s] because there's a sense that I know we both always have
[6486.38s - 6492.46s] that to shift the world, it's going to take a lot of us.
[6492.46s - 6496.64s] I'm going to have to work together.
[6496.64s - 6500.00s] And what I love about you is that you are always spotlighting your friends.
[6500.00s - 6501.80s] You're always showing up for your friends.
[6501.96s - 6504.96s] You're always supporting your friends behind the scenes and on camera.
[6504.96s - 6507.96s] And I'm just so grateful that you made time for me today.
[6507.96s - 6510.96s] I always say to people, my public life is amazing,
[6510.96s - 6512.96s] but my private life is better.
[6512.96s - 6517.06s] And my private life is better because of people like you
[6517.06s - 6521.22s] because we get to have genuine relationships and see a deep,
[6521.22s - 6523.22s] real relationships for years offline.
[6523.22s - 6525.22s] And they support everything online.
[6525.22s - 6528.22s] If someone's online life is better than their offline life,
[6528.22s - 6530.22s] that's a really hard place to live.
[6530.22s - 6532.22s] And I'm so grateful that because of friends like you,
[6532.22s - 6534.22s] I get to say the opposite.
[6534.22s - 6538.22s] Well, Jay, I think when things feel dark,
[6538.22s - 6540.22s] the job and life is to glow.
[6540.22s - 6543.22s] And you've definitely taught me how to do that.
[6543.22s - 6544.22s] Thank you.
[6544.22s - 6546.22s] I want to give you a big hug.
[6546.22s - 6548.31s] I want to give you a big hug too.
[6548.31s - 6549.31s] I love you.
[6549.31s - 6550.31s] I love you too.
[6550.31s - 6551.31s] Really, really love you.
[6551.31s - 6552.31s] Yeah.
[6552.31s - 6554.31s] And thank you to all of you as well.
[6554.31s - 6559.66s] Like just all of you that are listening and watching right now,
[6559.66s - 6561.66s] you're already on the path.
[6561.66s - 6564.21s] The fact that you're listening to Mel,
[6564.21s - 6565.21s] this is the path.
[6565.21s - 6567.21s] You don't have to start something new.
[6567.21s - 6569.21s] You don't have to suddenly figure it out.
[6569.21s - 6570.21s] You are figuring it out.
[6570.21s - 6571.21s] That's why you're here.
[6571.21s - 6576.21s] So please feel encouraged and fueled and connected,
[6576.21s - 6578.21s] knowing that you've already committed.
[6578.21s - 6580.21s] You're already showing up for yourself.
[6580.21s - 6582.21s] You've already invested in yourself.
[6582.21s - 6584.21s] The fact that you're on the path,
[6584.21s - 6588.21s] the fact that you're here proves that you're already living the
[6588.21s - 6589.21s] world that you want to live in.
[6589.21s - 6591.21s] So don't feel like you've got to start something,
[6591.21s - 6592.21s] figure it out.
[6592.21s - 6593.21s] That you're stuck.
[6593.21s - 6594.21s] You're already not stuck.
[6594.21s - 6595.21s] You're already moving.
[6595.21s - 6596.21s] If you were stuck, you wouldn't be here.
[6596.21s - 6600.21s] See that as building momentum and keep showing up.
[6600.21s - 6601.21s] Jay, thank you.
[6601.21s - 6602.21s] Thank you.
[6602.21s - 6603.21s] Thank you.
[6603.21s - 6606.21s] I also want to thank you for listening and watching all the way to the
[6606.21s - 6607.21s] end.
[6607.21s - 6610.21s] And what I'm really excited about is I agree with you, Jay,
[6610.21s - 6613.30s] that you're already moving into the right direction.
[6613.30s - 6617.30s] And everything that Jay poured into you and into me today,
[6617.30s - 6621.30s] as the sun is even getting brighter in here in our studios in Boston,
[6621.30s - 6624.30s] is how you turn on that switch.
[6624.30s - 6628.30s] And you actually tap into not only the light that's inside you,
[6628.30s - 6631.30s] but you also, we talked a lot about receiving.
[6631.30s - 6635.30s] That is a skill that I had to learn.
[6635.30s - 6640.30s] And when you focus on noticing what's around you and allowing it in,
[6640.30s - 6642.30s] you will feel more loved.
[6642.30s - 6644.30s] You will feel better.
[6644.30s - 6646.30s] I just so believe that.
[6646.30s - 6648.30s] And I wanted to tell you, in case no one else does,
[6648.30s - 6650.30s] that I love you and I believe in you.
[6650.30s - 6653.30s] And I believe in your ability to create a better life.
[6653.30s - 6657.30s] And there is no doubt in my mind that based on everything that Jay just
[6657.30s - 6660.43s] poured into you, you actually will.
[6660.43s - 6661.43s] Alrighty.
[6661.43s - 6662.43s] I'll see you in a few days.
[6662.43s - 6665.43s] I'll be waiting to welcome you in to the very next episode,
[6665.43s - 6666.43s] the moment you hit play.
[6666.43s - 6667.43s] I'll see you there.
[6667.43s - 6669.43s] You're definitely going to love this one.
[6669.43s - 6671.43s] And I'm going to be waiting to welcome you into it the moment you hit play.
[6671.43s - 6672.43s] I'll see you there.
