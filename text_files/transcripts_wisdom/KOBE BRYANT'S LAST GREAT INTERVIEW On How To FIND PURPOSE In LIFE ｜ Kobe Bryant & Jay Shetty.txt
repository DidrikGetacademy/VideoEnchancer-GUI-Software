[0.00s - 3.84s] To say, okay, it's okay to fail because you're going to be loved no matter what.
[3.84s - 7.68s] I had to look at it from a long term because I wasn't going to give up on the game.
[7.68s - 8.18s] Right.
[8.18s - 10.72s] So I had to say, okay, this year I'm going to get better at that.
[11.36s - 13.92s] Next year, this, and then so forth and so on.
[13.92s - 15.84s] And then patiently I was able to catch them.
[18.93s - 22.37s] The first question I want to ask you because so much of your content right now that you're
[22.37s - 27.49s] creating here at Granite is aimed at helping young people, aimed at helping children.
[27.49s - 30.37s] And as a father of four girls, I wanted to ask you,
[30.37s - 34.21s] what's the biggest thing you've learned about yourself by being a father?
[35.73s - 36.85s] You know, it's amazing.
[36.85s - 41.81s] Like when you become a parent, things become much more, you know, life becomes,
[42.53s - 45.65s] you know, it lines things up for you a little differently.
[45.65s - 45.97s] Right.
[45.97s - 49.01s] Like before you have kids, me and my wife, we can travel anytime.
[49.89s - 55.01s] You know, there's work and, you know, you become very, you have a very clear focus.
[55.57s - 57.81s] When you have children, it becomes about them.
[57.81s - 59.81s] It's not about you guys anymore.
[59.81s - 60.05s] Right.
[60.05s - 62.05s] And so that shift, it's a big one.
[62.61s - 66.93s] You know, it's one of kind of selfishness together.
[67.57s - 70.93s] And then to being absolutely selfless and doing anything you can for your kids.
[70.93s - 75.49s] And so what I'm trying to do is create content to teach them first and foremost.
[75.49s - 79.33s] That's why I started this whole thing is just reading stories to them that I felt like didn't
[79.33s - 82.05s] exist in our kids or athletes.
[82.77s - 86.77s] And they love reading about princesses and all these fairy tales.
[86.85s - 91.41s] And, you know, they get a little sick and tired about the man saving the princess every time.
[91.41s - 95.17s] And, you know, the same old stuff, magical wines and all that.
[95.17s - 96.53s] My kids are athletes, man.
[96.53s - 99.89s] They want to learn about soccer balls and basketballs and volleyball and,
[100.45s - 102.05s] you know, magic that comes from that.
[102.61s - 102.85s] Yeah.
[102.85s - 106.77s] And I love that you're encouraging young people to think more imaginatively about sports.
[106.77s - 107.17s] Yeah.
[107.17s - 109.09s] And I think that's what you go a step deeper.
[109.09s - 114.13s] You know, for me, observing you and learning about you and hearing you speak in other interviews
[114.13s - 114.53s] and everything.
[114.53s - 118.93s] What I'm fascinated by is that you've dealt with things in life pretty head on, right?
[118.93s - 119.81s] You've always gone at it.
[119.81s - 120.69s] What took you a while?
[120.69s - 124.53s] What was something in your life that you were shy about originally or that took your
[124.53s - 125.65s] while to go head on with?
[125.65s - 127.65s] But then finally you got there and you figured it out.
[128.69s - 133.97s] Writing Dear Basketball, that was a hard jump, you know, because I had written before.
[133.97s - 138.93s] I mean, I started writing probably about 17 years ago until practicing every day.
[138.93s - 141.25s] A lot of things that I wrote were ads.
[141.81s - 143.17s] And so you write an ad.
[143.17s - 145.17s] You know, nobody looks up at who wrote the ad, right?
[145.17s - 150.29s] You can kind of, there's a certain anonymity that comes along with that, right?
[150.29s - 151.97s] But writing Dear Basketball was different.
[152.53s - 154.45s] You know, it's putting it out there for the world to see.
[154.45s - 155.97s] It's trying to create a short film.
[156.61s - 158.61s] And I didn't know if I could do it, man.
[158.61s - 162.85s] And, you know, it was my daughter who kind of put things in perspective for me.
[162.85s - 167.41s] Gianna, she's now 13 and she was like, well, you know, you always tell us to go for it.
[168.05s - 168.21s] So.
[169.17s - 171.36s] Do you put you on the spot?
[171.36s - 172.72s] Yeah, she put me on the spot.
[172.72s - 174.00s] She was like, you're going to talk about it?
[174.00s - 175.44s] You're going to be about it, basically.
[175.44s - 177.76s] And, you know, that gave me the final push.
[177.76s - 178.24s] I love that.
[178.24s - 183.36s] When you started writing 17 years ago, did you envision that one day you would move into
[183.36s - 184.96s] this storytelling space?
[184.96s - 186.32s] Or was it just something you enjoyed at the time?
[187.36s - 187.84s] No, man.
[187.84s - 190.08s] It was just something I enjoyed and I enjoyed writing ads.
[190.08s - 195.60s] It was something funny about trying to distill a message down into 30 seconds or a minute,
[195.60s - 197.36s] depending on the budget, you know what I mean?
[197.36s - 203.44s] Trying to say something important, trying to speak to the, you know, brand attributes,
[203.44s - 207.28s] but also speak to something that's greater and that has a stronger message,
[207.28s - 208.64s] stronger philosophical message.
[208.64s - 210.32s] And how do you connect those dots?
[210.32s - 213.20s] So putting that puzzle together was something that was really intriguing.
[213.20s - 218.56s] But like, you know, I'd never thought I'd be writing novels or movies and that sort of stuff.
[218.56s - 219.28s] Never, man.
[219.28s - 219.92s] I love that, man.
[219.92s - 221.68s] I love it how everything evolves naturally.
[221.68s - 223.76s] And actually hearing you say that, it reminds me.
[223.76s - 227.92s] So my vision, when I was sharing earlier, became very clearly making wisdom go viral.
[227.92s - 233.44s] And I was like, how do I take these teachings that are like so sacred, they're hidden away in
[233.44s - 234.40s] these books?
[234.40s - 237.76s] And how do I make them really relevant and accessible and practical to the whole world?
[238.32s - 240.40s] Because I know that anyone can access them.
[240.40s - 241.52s] They're universal, right?
[241.52s - 244.64s] These, these teachings can apply to anyone, but sometimes they're just hidden away.
[245.20s - 246.88s] And a young person doesn't know how to find them.
[246.88s - 248.48s] So that inspires me hearing them.
[248.48s - 251.20s] That's beautiful too, because especially in today's,
[252.16s - 254.08s] in today's world, there's so much clutter.
[254.80s - 259.60s] You know, it becomes harder for kids to try to weave through a lot of the crap that's out there
[259.60s - 262.40s] to find stuff that's actually beneficial to them.
[262.40s - 262.72s] Yeah.
[262.72s - 263.92s] It was, I think you reminded me.
[263.92s - 269.36s] I think E.O. Wilson said, we're drowning in information starving for wisdom.
[269.36s - 270.56s] Yeah, that's for sure.
[270.56s - 273.92s] Especially, and that's why I think your work is cutting through, because I think what you've
[273.92s - 278.08s] managed to do with your new work is that you're finding ways to connect with what people care
[278.08s - 280.56s] about, but you're taking it a step deeper.
[280.56s - 281.04s] Yeah.
[281.04s - 283.36s] Right? You're not, you're not just settling for like, let's talk about sports.
[283.36s - 285.36s] It's not just about sports, it's about life, right?
[285.36s - 287.76s] It's about the metaphor that sports has for life.
[287.76s - 291.84s] I mean, you know, sports is the greatest, greatest metaphor we have in terms of dealing
[291.84s - 292.24s] with life.
[292.24s - 295.52s] Because, you know, even if you listen to music, music could give you guidance,
[296.40s - 300.56s] right, that you can then meditate on and think about how you would apply it.
[300.56s - 303.52s] In sports, you have to apply it in the here and now.
[303.52s - 307.92s] I mean, your face which challenges moment to moment, your face with pressures and anxiety
[307.92s - 311.52s] and communication or the lack thereof and all this other stuff.
[311.52s - 312.72s] Like it's in the moment.
[312.72s - 314.16s] So you have to live it.
[314.16s - 316.72s] And when you practice those things, you become better at it.
[316.72s - 322.32s] But I just feel like in this day and age, our children have become less imaginative
[322.32s - 327.76s] about how to problem solve and parents and coaches have become more directive in trying
[327.76s - 334.00s] to mandate or give orders or teach kids how to think and teach kids how to behave versus
[334.00s - 336.24s] and tell them how to behave versus teaching them how to behave.
[336.80s - 339.04s] And so that's why I'm creating these stories and creating this content.
[339.04s - 339.28s] Yeah.
[339.28s - 339.76s] I love that.
[339.76s - 340.48s] I think it's so true.
[340.48s - 344.08s] When you treat people as kids, then they always be kids, right?
[344.08s - 345.20s] Even when they grow up.
[345.20s - 348.32s] And for you, it was really powerful because you've talked about this before where your
[348.32s - 351.36s] father said to you, like, whether you score zero or 60.
[351.36s - 351.76s] Yeah.
[351.76s - 352.56s] Like, I love you.
[352.56s - 353.12s] Yeah.
[353.12s - 357.20s] Tell me what that statement meant to you at that time and how did it actually motivate
[357.20s - 361.28s] you to continue scoring 60 rather than go, oh, I'm all right at zero?
[361.28s - 362.88s] Well, it did more than that, right?
[362.88s - 368.24s] So like the basketball stuff speaks for itself in terms of what that comment made,
[368.24s - 374.32s] you know, did for me in terms of giving me stability and giving me confidence to say,
[374.32s - 377.52s] okay, it's okay to fail because you're going to be loved no matter what.
[378.32s - 381.04s] And that doesn't just mean basketball.
[381.04s - 382.64s] That means anything in life.
[382.64s - 383.68s] That means writing.
[383.68s - 385.76s] That means being an entrepreneur.
[385.76s - 390.00s] That means having the confidence to go for it.
[390.56s - 394.24s] And I've seen too many parents do the exact opposite.
[394.80s - 398.64s] And it terrifies children and children become paralyzed by their own fear
[399.84s - 402.96s] because they don't have that security blanket of love and comfort.
[403.92s - 404.96s] Yeah, absolutely.
[404.96s - 412.24s] How have you been able to in your life see past the cloud of emotion to actually execute on
[412.24s - 412.48s] things?
[412.48s - 415.52s] Because I think what we were speaking about earlier, this challenge that young people
[415.52s - 419.76s] have today, everyone has today, have just so much information, so much cloud of emotion,
[419.84s - 423.44s] so many feelings, so much childhood baggage that you're bringing.
[423.44s - 427.28s] Like how have you always cut through that and execute on that?
[427.28s - 432.72s] What I try to do is just try to be still and understand that things come and go,
[433.52s - 434.72s] emotions come and go.
[435.28s - 439.79s] The important thing is to accept them all, to embrace them all.
[440.51s - 447.15s] And then you can choose to do with them what you want versus being controlled by emotion.
[448.03s - 451.31s] A lot of times I've seen players, even myself, when I was younger,
[451.87s - 453.95s] being consumed by a particular fear.
[455.31s - 458.51s] And to the point where you're saying, okay, no, it's not good to feel fear.
[458.51s - 461.23s] I shouldn't be nervous in a situation like that.
[461.23s - 465.79s] And it does nothing but grow versus stepping back and saying, yeah, I am nervous about the
[465.79s - 466.51s] situation.
[466.51s - 468.11s] Yeah, I am fearful about the situation.
[468.11s - 469.31s] But what am I afraid of?
[469.31s - 473.63s] And then you kind of unpack it and then it gives you ability to look at it for really
[473.63s - 476.43s] what it is, which is nothing more than your imagination.
[477.39s - 478.27s] Running its course.
[478.91s - 479.55s] Yeah, absolutely.
[479.55s - 480.11s] Yeah, I love that.
[480.11s - 482.75s] Because what you're saying is that when you're dealing with something, it's almost like,
[482.75s - 484.03s] how can I get to the root of it?
[484.03s - 484.43s] Yeah.
[484.43s - 486.99s] Because sometimes what we're dealing with, like you're saying, it's an imagination,
[486.99s - 487.47s] an illusion.
[487.47s - 488.91s] It's not really a struggle.
[488.91s - 490.03s] It's not really a thing.
[491.07s - 494.67s] You think about game-winning shots or game-winning free throws.
[494.67s - 496.75s] And people go to the free throw line and they're nervous about it.
[496.75s - 498.03s] Well, what are you really nervous about?
[498.03s - 500.91s] If you want to unpack that, okay, you're nervous that you're going to miss the shot.
[501.39s - 501.79s] All right.
[501.79s - 503.39s] So you miss the shot, then what happens?
[503.39s - 504.99s] People are going to be embarrassed.
[505.07s - 507.47s] You're going to be embarrassed because thousands of people, millions of people,
[507.47s - 508.43s] see you miss the shot.
[508.43s - 508.83s] All right.
[508.83s - 509.47s] And then what?
[509.47s - 510.83s] People are going to talk bad about you.
[511.39s - 512.11s] Okay.
[512.11s - 512.35s] Right.
[512.35s - 514.99s] And so you look at it and you go, are those things even important?
[516.19s - 516.83s] You know what I mean?
[516.83s - 520.83s] If that is my fear, like what is, you're worried about letting your teammates down?
[520.83s - 521.07s] Okay.
[521.07s - 522.43s] Have you let them down before?
[522.43s - 523.07s] Oh, I'm sure.
[523.07s - 524.59s] And practice and things of that nature, right?
[524.59s - 525.31s] They're still there.
[525.31s - 525.87s] Yeah.
[525.87s - 526.51s] You know?
[526.51s - 529.07s] And so when you're able to unpack it, you kind of look at it for what it is,
[529.07s - 530.19s] which is really nothing.
[530.19s - 530.51s] Yeah.
[530.51s - 530.99s] I love that.
[530.99s - 531.47s] Breaking it down.
[531.47s - 532.43s] I think that's so important.
[532.43s - 534.19s] And I think everyone who's listening and watching right now,
[534.19s - 537.87s] next time you're facing a fear, next time you're going against something, do that.
[537.87s - 539.55s] Like literally unpack it.
[539.55s - 543.55s] Don't just settle for your first answer because the first answer is really the right one.
[543.55s - 544.51s] Don't hide from it.
[545.23s - 549.63s] You got to be able to look at it and deal with it head on.
[550.51s - 550.99s] Yeah.
[550.99s - 551.87s] I love that, man.
[551.87s - 555.07s] And you talk about that because you talk about, you know, when you talk about missing
[555.71s - 559.47s] five throws and you talk about getting over yourself, right?
[559.47s - 560.67s] Like getting over yourself.
[560.67s - 564.03s] How did you get that mentality of just being like, I need to get over this?
[564.03s - 565.39s] Like I need to get over myself.
[565.39s - 570.11s] You know, trial and error, you know, you grow up and you make game winning shots and it's awesome.
[570.11s - 573.55s] You come back the next day and miss a game winning shot and it's misery.
[573.55s - 576.91s] And then the next day comes and you're back playing again and you understand that life
[576.91s - 581.39s] has this cyclical nature where it's, you know, what you do on Monday is fantastic,
[581.39s - 582.83s] but then Tuesday is a bad day.
[582.83s - 583.31s] But guess what?
[583.31s - 584.43s] There's Wednesday.
[584.43s - 586.51s] So are we just supposed to live our lives like this the whole time?
[587.15s - 590.75s] You know, versus just staying like this and understanding that it's really just a journey
[590.75s - 595.87s] of evolution every day is just constant improvement, constant curiosity, constantly
[595.87s - 596.83s] getting better.
[596.83s - 598.51s] The results don't really matter.
[599.55s - 602.35s] It's the figuring out that matters.
[602.35s - 602.67s] Yeah.
[602.67s - 604.51s] And we all get obsessed about the results.
[604.51s - 604.99s] Yeah.
[604.99s - 607.15s] Like we get obsessed about like the output.
[607.15s - 607.47s] Yeah.
[607.47s - 610.75s] Not the input of not figuring it out and not like changing things.
[610.75s - 612.99s] What you said trial and error, like the experimenting.
[612.99s - 613.23s] Yeah.
[613.23s - 614.11s] We forget to do that.
[614.11s - 614.99s] It's unfortunate, man.
[614.99s - 619.71s] Like I've seen a lot of players, especially now, you know, and youth basketball dealing with that.
[620.83s - 624.75s] You know, players that are like bigger and faster and stronger and, you know,
[624.75s - 627.55s] their coaches are just coaching them for results.
[627.55s - 630.35s] You know, we're just going to use your size that because you're bigger than every other
[630.35s - 634.43s] 12 year old out there to dominate today, but they're not growing.
[635.23s - 635.47s] Right.
[635.47s - 639.87s] So they're just based on that result, but they're not focused on growing this young child
[640.43s - 642.03s] into becoming a better an athlete.
[642.03s - 646.03s] And through that, teaching them how to become a more well rounded person.
[646.67s - 648.11s] And we're missing that.
[648.11s - 648.35s] Yeah.
[648.35s - 649.31s] See what you've said there?
[649.31s - 653.47s] Just, I want to ask you this and I'm not saying it because I, you know, like you know
[653.47s - 655.07s] yourself best and you know how you've got there.
[655.07s - 657.95s] So I'm asking it from a place of humility of learning.
[657.95s - 662.27s] When I look at you, I'm like, you know, your superpower isn't just your work ethic.
[662.27s - 664.35s] Your superpower isn't just like figuring things out.
[664.35s - 666.19s] Your superpower is like you think strategically.
[666.19s - 673.04s] Like that's a very strategic thought of saying this person could be this in the future if
[673.04s - 677.28s] they were developed as a whole individual rather than just like let's use them for the short term.
[677.28s - 678.08s] Right.
[678.08s - 683.12s] Where did you develop that from that ability to see beyond to think deeper to reflect deeper?
[683.12s - 683.84s] Where did that come from?
[684.48s - 688.88s] Well, I had to do that because, you know, I grew up growing up in Italy.
[688.88s - 692.32s] When I first moved over there was, you know, I didn't speak Italian.
[692.32s - 693.52s] I didn't have any friends.
[693.52s - 696.72s] You know, I had the game of basketball and through sport and playing soccer.
[696.72s - 698.96s] I was able to make friends and build connections.
[698.96s - 701.52s] But it was a lot of time spent alone.
[701.52s - 705.44s] And when I came back to the States, I wasn't the most athletic kid.
[705.44s - 710.16s] You know, I was really scrawny, like really, really skinny and had like major knee issues
[710.16s - 710.88s] because I was growing.
[710.88s - 714.64s] So I was the dorky kid with high socks and big old knee pads.
[714.64s - 715.52s] It's fashionable now.
[715.52s - 716.48s] It's fashionable now.
[716.48s - 717.92s] One then, one then.
[717.92s - 723.76s] And so I had to look long term because in the here and now I couldn't compete with these kids.
[723.76s - 727.52s] I mean, there was kids that were like 12 years old with beards.
[727.52s - 728.08s] Like I can't.
[729.36s - 730.56s] What am I supposed to do with that?
[730.56s - 733.04s] Like they're doing windmills and dunking backwards.
[733.04s - 735.04s] And I'm happy to like tap the backboard.
[735.04s - 739.60s] You know, so I had to look at it from a long term because I wasn't going to give up on the game.
[739.60s - 740.16s] Right.
[740.16s - 742.64s] So I had to say, okay, this year I'm going to get better at that.
[743.44s - 745.92s] Next year, this and then so forth and so on.
[745.92s - 748.32s] And then patiently I was able to catch them.
[748.32s - 752.00s] Yeah, that's I love hearing that because I think so many of us kind of,
[752.00s - 754.56s] you believe like when you see people like yourself, it's like,
[754.56s - 758.48s] it's so easy as an excuse to ourselves to just, oh, you're destined for it, right?
[758.48s - 759.60s] You were made for it.
[759.60s - 763.84s] Kind of like that kind of, you know, like, oh, yes, you know, but when you talk about saying,
[763.84s - 769.04s] oh, actually when I started, I didn't have the physicality that meant that I was going to make it.
[769.04s - 770.48s] Like you had to figure it out and I love it.
[770.48s - 771.28s] Figure it out, man.
[771.28s - 772.64s] It's just piece by piece.
[772.64s - 778.32s] And it's the consistency of the work, which I feel like a lot of parents are missing today
[778.32s - 779.68s] because we're not teaching that to our kids.
[779.68s - 781.60s] We tend to say like kids don't want to do the work,
[781.60s - 784.08s] but in reality it's when we're failing them because we're not
[785.20s - 789.92s] leading them the right way and teaching them, you know, how to fish, you know what I mean?
[789.92s - 793.68s] And so like the consistency of work, Monday, get better.
[793.76s - 794.88s] Tuesday, get better.
[794.88s - 796.16s] Wednesday, get better, right?
[796.16s - 800.32s] And you do that over a period of time, you know, not like one month or two months.
[800.32s - 804.72s] I mean, it's three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 years.
[804.72s - 806.88s] And then you, you know, you can get to where you want to go.
[806.88s - 807.76s] Yeah, I can't remember.
[807.76s - 809.12s] I think it was Bill Gates who was talking about that.
[809.12s - 812.64s] He talks about how like we, we overestimate what we can do in one year
[812.64s - 814.40s] and underestimate what we can do in 10 years.
[814.40s - 814.96s] No doubt.
[814.96s - 815.52s] Right.
[815.52s - 816.24s] It's like that.
[816.24s - 817.04s] No doubt.
[817.04s - 819.28s] Like I think everyone thinks about like, what can I do right now?
[819.28s - 820.32s] Like how can I make it happen?
[820.32s - 823.12s] But like with you, I think people always ask you also like, you know,
[823.12s - 824.56s] how do you deal with losing or failure?
[824.56s - 828.08s] What I'm intrigued by is how someone like you deals with winning
[828.96s - 830.96s] because you've won again and again.
[830.96s - 832.96s] And like I was saying earlier, you, you know, you want,
[832.96s - 836.00s] obviously we know you want to basketball big as an athlete,
[836.00s - 838.24s] but you've, you're winning now, even in the work you're doing here
[838.24s - 840.16s] as a storyteller, as a producer, right?
[840.16s - 843.92s] It's amazing to see so many incredible awards coming through.
[843.92s - 845.68s] How have you dealt with winning?
[845.68s - 850.11s] Like when you win, what goes through your mind to help you to continue?
[850.11s - 851.23s] Well, it's still different.
[851.23s - 855.15s] Like in basketball, it was different because I expected to win.
[856.03s - 858.75s] You know, like I expected us to win championships.
[858.75s - 859.95s] I expected us to win five.
[859.95s - 861.71s] Quite honestly, I expected us to win eight.
[863.39s - 866.75s] And so when you have that vision in sports, it's a direct competition.
[866.75s - 868.35s] Like I know how hard they're working.
[868.35s - 869.55s] I know how hard we're working.
[869.55s - 871.39s] I know what their strategy is.
[871.39s - 872.91s] I know what ours is, you know.
[872.91s - 873.79s] So it's a little different.
[873.79s - 876.91s] So when we went in the NBA, it was like, yeah, we expected to do that.
[877.71s - 880.83s] But now we, we're going to come back and we're going to do it again.
[880.83s - 881.23s] You know?
[881.23s - 883.87s] And so it's that constant like, all right, you're turning.
[883.87s - 884.91s] You win one championship.
[884.91s - 887.15s] I'm back in the gym the next day working, getting ready for the next one.
[887.87s - 891.55s] Now it's different because it's not about the awards.
[891.55s - 893.71s] You know, you just wound up trying to create something that's,
[894.27s - 899.07s] that's going to inspire someone that hopefully, you know,
[899.07s - 901.47s] through that inspiration, they can inspire somebody else.
[901.47s - 904.03s] And what I've come to learn as my career went on is that's more
[904.03s - 907.87s] significant than any championship is how do you connect with somebody
[907.87s - 909.23s] that can then connect with another.
[910.03s - 914.91s] And then with whether the awards come or not, you know, that's for, you know,
[916.75s - 921.39s] you know, the Academy Award body to decide.
[921.39s - 924.19s] But, you know, like for us, it's just to try to create things.
[924.19s - 924.43s] Yeah.
[924.43s - 928.91s] Well, I guess now that's what shifted that now the intention isn't even expecting
[928.91s - 929.31s] to win.
[929.31s - 930.83s] It's expecting to change lives.
[930.83s - 931.15s] Right.
[931.15s - 931.23s] Right.
[931.23s - 935.07s] Like your content is really about making a difference and an impact on young people's
[935.07s - 939.23s] lives, which I think is like the biggest way of winning.
[939.23s - 939.87s] I think so.
[939.87s - 944.03s] I mean, you know, we're looking at 62% of young children are dropping out of sports,
[944.03s - 945.39s] 62%.
[945.39s - 947.55s] And they cite the fact that it's not fun anymore.
[948.11s - 949.07s] Well, what is that telling them?
[949.07s - 951.47s] That's telling us, us as grownups are getting in the way.
[952.53s - 953.41s] Get out the way.
[953.41s - 956.13s] Let these kids be imaginative, which, you know, like in our stories,
[956.13s - 960.21s] it's important that, yeah, there's a fantasy nature to it, right?
[960.21s - 963.06s] But it's rooted in reality, right?
[963.06s - 967.54s] When we have fire-breathing winged horses and things of that nature,
[968.18s - 970.50s] those are actual drills that are taking place.
[970.50s - 974.50s] We don't have fire-breathing winged horses actually performing that,
[974.50s - 979.46s] but we do have ball machines that are spitting balls at tennis players, right?
[979.46s - 984.98s] And so all of our stories are all anchored in an element of truth,
[984.98s - 988.66s] so that children feel like when they are doing these drills with these ball machines,
[988.66s - 991.38s] they can envision maybe it's a fire-breathing winged horse.
[992.34s - 993.38s] Yeah, to keep them excited.
[993.38s - 993.86s] Yeah, yeah.
[993.86s - 996.34s] They can envision gusts throwing fireballs at them, you know?
[996.34s - 996.98s] Yeah, yeah.
[996.98s - 1000.98s] And even the plays, like when the, you know, in the Wizzin' Art series,
[1000.98s - 1003.22s] when the basket is opening up and shrinking,
[1003.78s - 1005.86s] these are things that we experience as athletes.
[1005.86s - 1008.26s] Like some days I feel like I can't make a shot, man,
[1008.26s - 1011.22s] and the basket feels like the size of a keyhole, you know?
[1011.78s - 1015.62s] Other days it looks like a swimming pool, you know?
[1015.62s - 1016.90s] That's magic.
[1016.90s - 1019.62s] And so we root our magic in reality,
[1019.62s - 1023.30s] so that when kids experience these things, particularly the failure side of it,
[1023.86s - 1026.02s] they can connect it to one of our stories and say,
[1026.02s - 1028.26s] okay, I've seen this before.
[1028.26s - 1029.38s] I know how to deal with this.
[1029.38s - 1029.94s] Yeah.
[1029.94s - 1030.90s] That's beautiful, man.
[1030.90s - 1031.38s] I love that.
[1031.38s - 1034.82s] That analogy of like feeling the basket bigger or smaller,
[1034.82s - 1035.70s] and like being able to vision that.
[1035.70s - 1036.66s] I can vision it right now.
[1036.66s - 1037.86s] I'm like, yeah, you're so right.
[1037.86s - 1039.14s] Like some days it looks huge.
[1039.14s - 1040.18s] And I love that.
[1040.18s - 1041.54s] That's such a great way of thinking about it.
[1041.54s - 1044.02s] And I guess so much of this is from your real-life vision.
[1044.02s - 1044.66s] Oh, yeah.
[1044.66s - 1044.82s] Oh, yeah.
[1044.82s - 1045.94s] Yeah, this is like some days.
[1045.94s - 1047.06s] Oh, I've experienced it.
[1047.06s - 1047.30s] Yeah.
[1048.10s - 1051.22s] But I love that because it's also giving them the permission to say like,
[1051.22s - 1053.14s] be imaginative about this, right?
[1053.14s - 1053.46s] Yes.
[1053.46s - 1056.98s] And that obviously gives so much, I think when we imagine,
[1058.06s - 1061.90s] it changes the reality of, oh, I'm just sitting out here taking shots.
[1061.90s - 1062.38s] Yes.
[1062.38s - 1062.78s] Right?
[1062.78s - 1064.22s] Which can get boring and tiring.
[1064.22s - 1065.18s] It becomes mechanical.
[1065.18s - 1065.74s] Mechanical.
[1065.74s - 1066.06s] That's the wrong word, yeah.
[1066.06s - 1066.78s] It becomes mechanical.
[1066.78s - 1071.34s] And you're like, our job is to try to inspire the creativity inside of our children
[1072.30s - 1075.42s] so that they can think through how to problem solve situations.
[1075.42s - 1077.98s] So like, you know, when I coach my daughter's team,
[1077.98s - 1079.42s] it's not about giving them answers.
[1080.06s - 1084.30s] It's about asking them questions and getting them to process things, right?
[1084.30s - 1087.50s] And when the game is being played, I'm not sitting there giving them answers
[1087.50s - 1088.86s] or barking out things on a sideline.
[1088.86s - 1090.30s] I sit down and I'm quiet.
[1090.30s - 1092.14s] My assistant coach sits there and she's quiet.
[1092.78s - 1095.58s] And the kids figure things out for themselves or they don't.
[1095.58s - 1097.74s] And then they come back and there's always questions.
[1097.74s - 1101.02s] And then you kind of ask them more questions and you help them figure it out.
[1101.02s - 1102.54s] But then you see their level of excitement.
[1102.54s - 1103.98s] The practice every day increase.
[1104.70s - 1107.66s] Because it's a process that they are owning, right?
[1107.66s - 1110.62s] They're not coming to get orders barked at them every day.
[1110.62s - 1116.46s] They're coming for kind of their personal quest to get better.
[1116.46s - 1117.18s] Yeah.
[1117.18s - 1118.62s] And how do you do it?
[1118.62s - 1119.74s] I just feel about you coaching.
[1119.74s - 1121.58s] I guess that style makes them feel comfortable.
[1121.58s - 1125.02s] But how have you been able to manage that with the pressure of you being there?
[1125.82s - 1129.50s] No, it's no pressure because, you know, it's their process to own.
[1129.50s - 1133.10s] I have knowledge information that I've gained through playing.
[1133.10s - 1136.62s] So like the little details of things I can teach at a high level.
[1137.50s - 1139.26s] But ultimately it's them.
[1140.30s - 1140.78s] Yeah.
[1140.78s - 1143.66s] You seem very still and detached about it.
[1143.66s - 1144.14s] Yeah.
[1144.14s - 1147.26s] I mean, it's, you know, the kids love playing basketball.
[1147.26s - 1149.02s] So that's the anchor of it all.
[1149.02s - 1152.62s] They come and they play and they learn and they have fun and, you know, and they compete.
[1152.62s - 1155.58s] And, you know, they challenge themselves and one another.
[1155.58s - 1159.18s] And, you know, they just get better every day.
[1159.18s - 1163.74s] Yeah. How have you seen that with, obviously with Legacy and the Queen, you chose tennis?
[1163.74s - 1164.06s] Yeah.
[1164.06s - 1166.46s] Like what was the, what was the choice of sports about?
[1166.46s - 1168.30s] I'm intrigued by the wide tennis.
[1168.30s - 1168.54s] Yeah.
[1168.54s - 1171.42s] So like the first novel we did was the Wizz and R series.
[1171.42s - 1176.46s] It was important that for that to be basketball because I wanted the first story to be one of empathy and compassion.
[1177.18s - 1179.66s] And in team sports, if you don't have that, you can't win.
[1180.50s - 1180.74s] Right.
[1180.74s - 1186.74s] And so it was important to tell the tale of a basketball team dealing with their own personal fears
[1186.74s - 1191.30s] and have those fears and insecurities lead to empathy and compassion for others.
[1192.10s - 1192.42s] Right.
[1192.42s - 1196.58s] And with the second story, I wanted to look more internal individually
[1197.30s - 1203.70s] and look at how do you deal with the inner challenges, the kind of the self negotiation that takes place inside of our own heads.
[1204.58s - 1207.30s] And there was no sport better than that than tennis.
[1207.30s - 1215.94s] There's golf, but tennis, you have more movement, which to me symbolizes life in general because life is, there's a lot going on.
[1216.50s - 1216.74s] Right.
[1216.74s - 1221.22s] There's the elements and tenants that you have to deal with as you deal with in golf, maybe not to the same extent,
[1221.22s - 1222.42s] but they're still there.
[1222.42s - 1225.54s] And then there's the confrontation with the person across the net from you.
[1225.70s - 1226.26s] Yes.
[1226.26s - 1226.58s] Right.
[1226.58s - 1231.62s] As well as the strengths and weaknesses in your own movements and how you feel in your own body.
[1232.18s - 1235.46s] And because of that, it was important for this story to be a tennis story.
[1236.26s - 1237.06s] I love that.
[1237.06s - 1238.18s] That makes complete sense.
[1238.18s - 1240.50s] And give me an example of that self negotiation.
[1240.50s - 1242.90s] I love that word and I get that.
[1242.90s - 1244.10s] Can you expand on that a bit?
[1244.18s - 1244.58s] Yeah.
[1244.58s - 1251.86s] Like, you know, you're out running on a track, working out, and you start talking to yourself saying,
[1251.86s - 1253.86s] man, my knee is really sore right now.
[1254.50s - 1256.66s] Maybe I'm maybe I'm doing too much.
[1256.66s - 1257.62s] It sounds like me.
[1257.62s - 1259.54s] Maybe I need to back off, you know.
[1260.10s - 1261.46s] Man, my lungs are burning.
[1261.46s - 1263.78s] And maybe I can just slow down here.
[1263.78s - 1266.50s] I'll do like an extra two sets tomorrow.
[1266.50s - 1267.62s] You know, it'll be okay.
[1267.62s - 1267.94s] Yeah.
[1267.94s - 1268.34s] Right.
[1268.34s - 1269.46s] That sort of stuff.
[1269.46s - 1269.86s] Yes.
[1269.86s - 1271.14s] Like that stuff's dangerous.
[1271.14s - 1271.62s] Yes.
[1271.62s - 1273.38s] And that's when you just got to say, you know what?
[1273.38s - 1274.74s] I'm not negotiating with myself.
[1275.38s - 1276.82s] The deal was already made.
[1276.82s - 1279.46s] The deal was made when I set out at the beginning of the summer and said,
[1279.46s - 1281.22s] this is the training plan I'm doing.
[1281.86s - 1283.94s] I signed that contract with myself.
[1283.94s - 1284.66s] I'm doing it.
[1285.22s - 1288.42s] You know, throughout the that process, you'll start talking to yourself like,
[1288.42s - 1294.82s] man, I got to, I think I need to maybe if we know, no, this is not negotiable.
[1294.82s - 1296.18s] Yeah, not negotiable.
[1296.18s - 1296.74s] Yeah.
[1296.74s - 1297.30s] Yeah, I love that.
[1297.30s - 1300.26s] And for you, empathy and compassion were things that you'd been through.
[1300.26s - 1302.66s] Like that was that was personally inspired work.
[1302.66s - 1303.06s] Yeah.
[1303.06s - 1308.34s] When did it come to your awareness that empathy was something missing for you
[1308.34s - 1309.62s] and that you wanted to develop it?
[1310.42s - 1315.46s] I had a teammate that spoke to me and said, hey, Cole, you know,
[1315.46s - 1318.18s] I just want to feel like as a teammate, you need me.
[1318.82s - 1323.68s] I was like, well, duh, I can't, I can't, you know,
[1324.24s - 1325.52s] like that was my media reaction.
[1325.52s - 1328.16s] I was like, dude, yeah, of course.
[1328.16s - 1330.64s] But I had to kind of think about really what he was saying
[1330.64s - 1332.88s] and where that was coming from for him.
[1333.76s - 1336.24s] And his story and his journey and what that meant to him.
[1336.88s - 1339.76s] And that opened my eyes to there's a bigger game being played.
[1339.76s - 1343.04s] It's not just basketball, but it's the emotions of each individual
[1343.92s - 1345.92s] and the backstory that they're carrying with them,
[1345.92s - 1347.68s] the baggage that they're carrying with them.
[1347.68s - 1350.56s] And if I really want to be a champion and be a great teammate,
[1350.56s - 1354.64s] I have to understand what those mean to help them become better.
[1354.64s - 1356.88s] And in turn, help me.
[1356.88s - 1357.36s] Yeah.
[1357.36s - 1361.36s] And do you think this content is going to help all the content you're creating here
[1361.36s - 1361.92s] at Granite?
[1361.92s - 1365.28s] Is that for you to help build better bonds between parents and kids?
[1365.28s - 1367.12s] Like, are you hoping that the podcast, for example,
[1367.12s - 1369.84s] like kids are going to listen to it on the way to school or on the way back?
[1369.84s - 1372.72s] Or like, how are you imagining people consuming the work?
[1372.72s - 1372.96s] Yeah.
[1372.96s - 1375.84s] I mean, I imagine it in different ways, you know,
[1375.84s - 1379.04s] but like ultimately people always figure out a way to do it
[1379.04s - 1380.08s] that's comfortable for them.
[1380.08s - 1384.08s] But like, you know, which is why and everything that we do,
[1384.08s - 1386.88s] we try to create the highest quality of product, right?
[1386.88s - 1389.28s] Like, you know, people will sit down and tell me they'll say,
[1389.28s - 1393.92s] OK, well, audio books, very small percentage of people listen to audio books.
[1393.92s - 1396.48s] We don't really have to invest too much in doing audio books.
[1396.48s - 1398.93s] And what, excuse me?
[1398.93s - 1402.93s] No, because that one person just listens to audio books.
[1402.93s - 1405.01s] That one family enjoys audio books.
[1405.01s - 1407.57s] They have to get the best experience that I could possibly give them.
[1407.57s - 1409.89s] So that means using a London Orchestra.
[1409.89s - 1411.25s] That means doing full symphonies.
[1411.25s - 1413.33s] That means having Felicia Rashad read the stories.
[1413.33s - 1416.13s] Like it means everything, the books themselves.
[1416.85s - 1417.73s] I got this all the time.
[1417.73s - 1419.57s] There's no money in making books, man.
[1419.57s - 1421.09s] Nobody makes money in books.
[1421.09s - 1424.21s] And I'm sorry, you want to make a book with using what material?
[1424.77s - 1428.05s] You want, you know, I'm like, you know, I'm like, uh, yeah,
[1428.05s - 1430.13s] because children matter.
[1430.13s - 1431.89s] So like, I don't know how they're going.
[1431.89s - 1434.37s] I imagine how they're going to be consuming content.
[1435.49s - 1438.69s] But ultimately it's my responsibility and our responsibility studio
[1438.69s - 1443.17s] to make every single thing that we put out the highest quality possible.
[1443.17s - 1444.13s] Yeah. Yeah.
[1444.13s - 1444.93s] No, I can imagine.
[1444.93s - 1448.21s] I can imagine parents listening to it on the way to school.
[1448.21s - 1451.89s] I can imagine listening on the way back or on the way to practice or things like that.
[1451.89s - 1452.61s] Like I think it's cool.
[1452.61s - 1453.97s] I think it's the punies for sure.
[1453.97s - 1457.65s] Like the punies, I was like, you know, when I first made the punies,
[1457.65s - 1458.93s] we're going to release it in the summer.
[1458.93s - 1460.13s] I think we released it in August.
[1461.33s - 1464.69s] And I think it was August around the same time.
[1464.69s - 1468.69s] But my mind was saying, okay, parents are going to listen to this every Saturday morning.
[1468.69s - 1473.89s] Because I know I'm in the car driving my kids to soccer games and like volleyball games and stuff.
[1473.89s - 1476.13s] So parents can listen to this with their kids in the car.
[1476.13s - 1477.41s] They're driving the sporting events.
[1477.41s - 1478.93s] Like that was kind of what I had in my mind.
[1479.65s - 1482.21s] And then when it came out, it's like, you know,
[1482.21s - 1487.09s] teachers were using it more so than anybody in classrooms and doing like classroom reports
[1487.09s - 1489.49s] on the punies and all sorts of stuff.
[1489.49s - 1491.57s] So, you know, never know.
[1491.57s - 1493.73s] It seems like you study life a lot, right?
[1493.73s - 1496.05s] Like when you're talking about all of this imagination,
[1496.05s - 1499.01s] which stems from your own work, like for example,
[1499.01s - 1501.01s] like when you're dealing with empathy and compassion,
[1501.01s - 1502.21s] it's reflected in the content.
[1502.29s - 1504.45s] When you're going through these visualizations,
[1504.45s - 1505.33s] what could this look like?
[1505.33s - 1506.13s] It goes in the content.
[1507.17s - 1508.37s] You study life a lot.
[1508.37s - 1510.61s] What currently are you studying?
[1510.61s - 1513.73s] And what kind of gets your imagination really growing right now?
[1513.73s - 1515.33s] Like what keeps that moving for you?
[1516.69s - 1520.61s] You know, there's a certain element of truth in everything, you know.
[1520.61s - 1526.37s] And, you know, the creativity generally comes from personal experiences first.
[1527.01s - 1531.41s] And then you kind of look on a broad, kind of on a broader scope of,
[1531.41s - 1537.65s] okay, how do you take something extremely personal and then channel it in a way for masses
[1537.65s - 1540.53s] to understand and get their arms around sort of thing.
[1540.53s - 1542.69s] But it always starts in the element of truth.
[1542.69s - 1549.41s] And then you start unpacking that by sitting in thought and figuring out like character and,
[1549.41s - 1552.45s] you know, who is this person and, you know, who's his family.
[1552.45s - 1555.41s] And then that's when I start getting in trouble, you know,
[1555.41s - 1558.29s] because it's like the questions don't end, you know.
[1558.29s - 1562.37s] So I have like books and books and books and books and books and books and books and books and books
[1562.37s - 1566.13s] of backstory because it's not good enough just to say to characters this way.
[1566.77s - 1568.05s] Why are they that way?
[1568.05s - 1568.69s] For the parents.
[1568.69s - 1570.05s] Well, where do the parents come from?
[1570.05s - 1571.09s] You know, where's the dad come from?
[1571.09s - 1572.53s] Why are they raising a kid this way?
[1572.53s - 1575.41s] And then, you know, what does it have to do with the economy that's around them?
[1575.41s - 1577.41s] And then, and just one thing leads to the next.
[1577.41s - 1579.09s] And then you're just writing all kinds of stuff.
[1581.09s - 1581.81s] That's crazy.
[1581.81s - 1582.61s] Yeah, that's awesome.
[1582.61s - 1586.45s] Because I think so many of us get, you know, in our lives, we get stuck with imagination
[1587.09s - 1589.57s] because you kind of get into that autopilot mode.
[1589.57s - 1593.01s] Doing the same thing every day, same routine, same drive to work.
[1593.01s - 1597.57s] And it's like, I feel that what you're sharing is that's easy for anyone to do.
[1597.57s - 1599.41s] It's not like, oh, because you're going to be right.
[1599.41s - 1601.33s] You don't feel that everyone gets into that.
[1601.33s - 1603.97s] You're able to find these creative outlets.
[1603.97s - 1607.65s] Yeah. Well, you know, like creativity is in everything, you know,
[1607.65s - 1613.41s] like even in consistent, like what I found is creativity a lot of time comes from structure.
[1614.13s - 1614.85s] I agree.
[1614.85s - 1616.05s] I'm so glad you said that.
[1616.05s - 1617.97s] You have those parameters and the structure.
[1617.97s - 1619.25s] Then within that, you can be creative.
[1619.25s - 1622.85s] But like, if you don't have the structure, you're just aimlessly doing stuff.
[1624.13s - 1624.37s] Yes.
[1624.37s - 1625.73s] You know, where are you going?
[1625.73s - 1630.45s] You know, so like having a clear structure of understanding, okay, this morning I'm going to,
[1630.45s - 1634.37s] like when I was writing a Wizard of Oz series and Outlining Legacy,
[1634.37s - 1637.33s] I come in in the morning, 7am, and I'm there.
[1638.24s - 1644.24s] I'm writing backstory from 7 to 12, then go pick up my kids and then I come right back
[1644.24s - 1644.88s] and I'm writing again.
[1644.88s - 1649.68s] So like within that structure, you know, my mind when I go to sleep is already
[1649.68s - 1652.56s] like planning of what the next day is going to be because I know,
[1653.28s - 1654.64s] you know, what it is I have to do.
[1654.64s - 1656.56s] It's that consistency and structure.
[1656.56s - 1657.68s] Yeah. I couldn't agree with you more.
[1657.68s - 1659.04s] I'm writing my first book right now.
[1659.04s - 1659.52s] Oh, wow.
[1659.52s - 1662.40s] And a lot of people have been asking me like, Jay, and I'm like that.
[1662.40s - 1665.76s] I have a very scheduled focus on writing and they'll be like,
[1665.76s - 1667.20s] well, how do you find inspiration at that time?
[1667.20s - 1668.56s] What if you're not inspired at that time?
[1668.56s - 1671.84s] And I'm like, no, the structure helps spontaneity, right?
[1671.84s - 1673.68s] It's that consistency that breeds creativity.
[1673.68s - 1674.64s] Well, that's the thing too.
[1674.64s - 1678.00s] It's like, you know, people think like it's you're just kind of just kind of,
[1679.23s - 1685.31s] you know, mulling along and all of a sudden, you know, like the show that we have on ESPN
[1685.31s - 1688.99s] now called Detail basketball, you know, sports breakdown show.
[1690.75s - 1694.43s] That came to me when I was walking around with my wife shopping.
[1695.23s - 1698.59s] And I look at a piece of fabric and I'm like, wow, this is really the detail.
[1698.59s - 1701.87s] And this thing is, oh my detail, this name of the show.
[1701.87s - 1703.31s] And then everything came from there.
[1703.31s - 1708.43s] But I had been thinking about a show like that for like a year, you know,
[1708.43s - 1710.59s] and I couldn't shake it loose.
[1710.59s - 1713.87s] I'm like, I got to find a sports show that I'm going to do,
[1713.87s - 1716.67s] but it needs to, can't just be basketball focus has to be broader.
[1717.31s - 1719.39s] And I want to hear from the best minds in the world.
[1719.39s - 1720.35s] I want to hear from Peyton Manning.
[1720.35s - 1721.55s] I want to hear from, what is it?
[1721.55s - 1722.75s] What is it for like a year?
[1722.75s - 1726.83s] And then all of a sudden, boom, you know, and so people think it just comes out of nowhere.
[1726.83s - 1730.27s] You know, you got to like obsess over it for a while and then it kind of pops loose.
[1730.27s - 1730.75s] Absolutely.
[1730.91s - 1734.43s] You had to plant the seed well before to see the fruit.
[1734.43s - 1734.59s] Yeah.
[1734.59s - 1736.11s] And you got to water it all the time.
[1736.11s - 1739.47s] Like you got to sit down and watch and watch other shows that are out there.
[1739.47s - 1742.83s] And like, you know, and then ultimately you just find, you know,
[1742.83s - 1746.83s] like when the answer comes to you, it's like, my God, I could have thought it out on the first day.
[1747.39s - 1751.71s] Remember John Williams told me that he said, he'll sit for like two months
[1751.71s - 1754.19s] to try to figure out what the melody is.
[1755.66s - 1758.30s] And he'll just be playing, he'll be at his piano all day.
[1758.30s - 1761.82s] He'll say, you only day he'll take off at Sunday because his wife forces him to take Sundays off.
[1762.38s - 1765.02s] And he'll just be sitting there writing, writing, writing.
[1765.02s - 1766.62s] And then it just comes.
[1767.42s - 1771.42s] And he's like, I seriously could have thought of that on the first day.
[1771.42s - 1771.90s] Like why?
[1773.90s - 1775.18s] It's just so simple.
[1775.18s - 1776.06s] Yeah, absolutely.
[1776.06s - 1777.42s] And that's what people don't realize as well.
[1777.42s - 1780.38s] Like when you go out, then you're shopping with your wife and you see the detail and you're like,
[1780.38s - 1781.50s] okay, that's the show.
[1781.50s - 1784.14s] And then you go back into consistency to create it.
[1784.14s - 1784.54s] Yeah.
[1784.54s - 1786.38s] It's like, you know, it wasn't just like, oh, now I thought of it.
[1786.38s - 1787.34s] I'm just going to throw that idea.
[1787.42s - 1789.42s] It was like, now I'm going back to the drawing board.
[1789.42s - 1791.42s] Have the name now built around it.
[1791.42s - 1797.02s] I try to, what I try to do is shoot the idea down and figure out everything that's wrong with the idea.
[1797.02s - 1797.74s] Ooh, okay.
[1797.74s - 1798.14s] Right.
[1798.14s - 1801.26s] This show won't work because like detail, for example,
[1801.26s - 1804.38s] it was like this show won't work because it's not for fans.
[1805.26s - 1806.86s] It's for the 1% athlete.
[1806.86s - 1807.42s] Yeah.
[1807.42s - 1807.98s] All right.
[1807.98s - 1809.90s] Well, will it be successful?
[1809.90s - 1810.86s] People connect to it.
[1810.86s - 1812.78s] Like, you know, you start unpacking every little thing.
[1812.78s - 1813.66s] How will we shoot it?
[1813.66s - 1815.34s] Can I even get Peyton Manning to do it?
[1815.34s - 1818.70s] Can I get, you know, and you start shooting them down.
[1818.70s - 1821.66s] Same thing with the novels, like characters and plots and stories.
[1821.66s - 1823.02s] Does this make any sense?
[1823.02s - 1823.90s] No. Here's why.
[1826.62s - 1828.54s] I felt like that really helps me.
[1828.54s - 1831.18s] Yeah. I like that approach a lot, actually, because I think sometimes,
[1831.18s - 1834.38s] especially right now in the world, we go to the wishful thinking side.
[1834.38s - 1834.46s] Yeah.
[1834.46s - 1837.50s] Like you have the positive vision and you're like, oh, this is how it's going to turn out.
[1837.50s - 1837.90s] Right.
[1837.90s - 1839.82s] And then you ignore the bad stuff.
[1839.82s - 1840.22s] Yeah.
[1840.22s - 1843.98s] Or you ignore the kind of like the pot holes or the loop holes because you're just like,
[1843.98s - 1845.74s] oh, no, I don't want to focus on the negativity.
[1845.74s - 1846.46s] Yeah.
[1846.46s - 1850.46s] But actually, what you're saying is if you're aware of it, of those known unknowns,
[1850.46s - 1851.90s] then you can actually break them down yourself.
[1851.90s - 1854.70s] Well, yeah, it's just like the same thing for any great movie.
[1855.26s - 1857.58s] You have to have the antagonist.
[1857.58s - 1858.22s] Yes.
[1858.22s - 1863.34s] You know, a strong villainous character will really drive the narrative along.
[1863.34s - 1867.02s] If you don't have that, you have nothing from which your hero has to bounce off of.
[1867.58s - 1871.74s] You know, that villain could be, you know, maleficent.
[1871.74s - 1873.58s] They could be something inside of you.
[1873.66s - 1877.50s] It could be whatever, but you have to have that clear antagonist that's driving the narrative
[1877.50s - 1877.82s] forward.
[1877.82s - 1880.30s] And so in this sense, it's the same thing.
[1880.30s - 1885.42s] You pick apart the negative and from that, you can then move forward.
[1885.42s - 1885.82s] Absolutely.
[1885.82s - 1890.90s] What I'm loving here right now is that all I'm hearing is like Kobe, the storyteller.
[1890.90s - 1891.62s] Like I'm loving it.
[1891.62s - 1896.10s] Like what I feel is like what I'm hearing about is your obsession and obsessiveness
[1896.98s - 1897.78s] with stories.
[1898.42s - 1902.10s] And it's not just like, you know, I'm sharing this.
[1902.18s - 1904.26s] It's like you've really studied stories.
[1904.26s - 1906.26s] Like you've really broken them down and understood it.
[1907.86s - 1911.22s] Tell me about where that obsession comes from in general, like how you find obsessiveness
[1911.22s - 1912.90s] and how you've applied that to story.
[1912.90s - 1913.22s] Yeah.
[1913.22s - 1915.78s] And you know, obsessiveness comes from something that you love.
[1915.78s - 1916.90s] Like you really love it.
[1916.90s - 1918.42s] You'll go through fire for it.
[1918.42s - 1920.66s] You know, you'll go through the ups and downs with it.
[1920.66s - 1922.98s] And you'll just keep at it because you love it so much, you know.
[1924.90s - 1926.50s] And story for me started a long time ago.
[1926.50s - 1930.74s] I mean, I had a great English teacher at Lower Merrin High School named Jay Mastriano.
[1931.38s - 1934.10s] And she explained to me the art of storytelling my sophomore year.
[1934.66s - 1938.18s] And that's why I started falling in love with it and understanding story structure.
[1939.94s - 1944.10s] You know, how to develop compelling characters and how this thing, how stories
[1945.22s - 1949.38s] are the driving force, whether they're inspirational or informational, that really
[1949.38s - 1950.74s] change society.
[1950.74s - 1951.46s] Yeah, absolutely.
[1951.46s - 1951.62s] Yeah.
[1951.62s - 1955.46s] We're defined by the stories we tell ourselves, whether personally or outside of the world.
[1955.46s - 1956.26s] Absolutely.
[1956.26s - 1957.06s] Absolutely.
[1957.06s - 1960.34s] And it seems like you just mentioned that it just shows the role of teachers.
[1960.58s - 1964.10s] And now when you find that teachers are using the work you're creating to teach,
[1964.10s - 1965.14s] that must be amazing.
[1965.14s - 1966.02s] Comes full circle.
[1966.02s - 1966.50s] Yeah.
[1966.50s - 1971.62s] You know, and, you know, it's a pretty cool feeling, man.
[1971.62s - 1974.50s] Like growing up, when I was in high school, man, I didn't read much at all.
[1974.50s - 1974.74s] Yeah.
[1975.46s - 1977.06s] You know, because basketball was my thing.
[1977.06s - 1981.62s] Now, if you give me a basketball book or like a sports book or like a sports psych book,
[1981.62s - 1982.74s] oh, I'm devouring that.
[1983.30s - 1983.86s] You know what I mean?
[1983.86s - 1983.94s] Yeah.
[1983.94s - 1987.62s] Because it was a clear focus for me, which kind of gets me into this market a little bit too.
[1987.62s - 1992.42s] Because like for our active children that love being outdoors and playing all the time,
[1992.42s - 1993.38s] they're not reading.
[1993.38s - 1994.02s] No.
[1994.02s - 1996.98s] But they're missing out on so much by not reading.
[1996.98s - 2002.34s] But they will read if there's something that they feel like speaks to them.
[2002.34s - 2003.22s] So true.
[2003.22s - 2003.70s] You know?
[2003.70s - 2007.70s] And so now I think we get more readers in the world because of it, hopefully.
[2007.70s - 2008.42s] That's so true.
[2008.42s - 2009.06s] No, I think so.
[2009.06s - 2009.70s] I agree with you.
[2009.70s - 2011.62s] Like for me, and this is why everyone's different.
[2011.62s - 2015.46s] And I think there's such a need for what you're doing because when I was growing up,
[2015.46s - 2016.82s] I never enjoyed fiction.
[2017.62s - 2021.38s] And so I thought I didn't like reading because all the books that the school suggested were
[2021.38s - 2022.18s] fiction books.
[2022.18s - 2026.10s] And then when I was 14, my dad handed me an autobiography and a biography.
[2026.10s - 2027.63s] And I devoured it.
[2027.63s - 2030.83s] And then I started reading because I was like, I want to hear about real people
[2030.83s - 2035.47s] who break and who develop and who learn and grow and like have been through failure.
[2035.47s - 2037.15s] And like I want to hear about rags to riches.
[2037.15s - 2040.27s] And I want to hear about like I want to hear about real people who went through real pain.
[2040.27s - 2040.99s] That's right.
[2040.99s - 2044.27s] But I grew up believing that I didn't like reading.
[2044.27s - 2045.87s] And I think that's you're so right.
[2045.87s - 2049.71s] I think there's a lot of kids out there who think they don't like reading or they think
[2049.71s - 2050.51s] reading is boring.
[2050.51s - 2054.99s] It's a problem because like what I found in the industry, which is why we self publish
[2055.63s - 2058.67s] because a lot of publishers want to publish the same type of story,
[2059.39s - 2067.23s] you know, the same type of plots, same looking characters, not a lot of diverse
[2067.23s - 2068.35s] characters out there at all.
[2068.99s - 2071.95s] And so we said, you know what, we're going to have to do this on our own.
[2071.95s - 2075.55s] This way we don't have anybody in our way telling us what the market wants to hear.
[2075.55s - 2076.51s] I don't care about that.
[2076.51s - 2080.67s] We write stories that come from the heart and our characters are going to look like
[2080.67s - 2083.71s] my daughters because my daughters don't have characters out there that look like them.
[2083.71s - 2084.35s] It's a great point.
[2084.35s - 2089.07s] So they're going to look like my kids and we're going to go from there.
[2089.07s - 2089.39s] Yeah.
[2089.39s - 2092.83s] I think what you just raised there about diversity and representation is huge.
[2092.83s - 2093.55s] It's huge, man.
[2093.55s - 2093.95s] Huge.
[2093.95s - 2094.83s] Because I don't see it, man.
[2094.83s - 2099.07s] And like, you know, so books is just the first thing.
[2099.07s - 2100.19s] Publishing is the first thing.
[2100.19s - 2103.55s] Now if we look at animation, animation is even worse.
[2103.55s - 2104.43s] It's even worse.
[2104.51s - 2109.55s] You know, in terms of developing characters, diverse characters, but even beyond that,
[2109.55s - 2114.03s] the animators themselves, there's no diversity in that industry.
[2114.03s - 2114.91s] Right.
[2114.91s - 2115.31s] None.
[2115.31s - 2118.75s] And I'm talking not just racial diversity, but gender diversity as well.
[2118.75s - 2124.43s] And so there's a lot of things that we need to take on that we are taking on and hope to
[2124.43s - 2126.75s] make the world and the industry a better place because of it.
[2126.75s - 2126.99s] Yeah.
[2126.99s - 2128.35s] No, I fully agree with that.
[2128.35s - 2129.63s] I'm a British Indian, right?
[2129.63s - 2130.75s] Born and raised in London.
[2130.75s - 2134.11s] And I've never seen any character that looked like me anywhere.
[2134.11s - 2134.43s] Right.
[2134.43s - 2137.55s] Because they think, you know, the mass market, they're not going to,
[2137.55s - 2138.91s] it's not going to appeal to the mass market.
[2138.91s - 2139.87s] So we're not going to do that.
[2139.87s - 2140.59s] Yeah, exactly.
[2140.59s - 2141.15s] Wait, what?
[2143.15s - 2143.47s] Yeah.
[2143.47s - 2147.31s] And everything's spreading so fast now and everything's global now, right?
[2147.31s - 2151.55s] Nearly all content is global now and most global markets are growing everywhere.
[2151.55s - 2156.11s] So the need for people, especially young people, being able to see themselves in characters.
[2156.11s - 2159.79s] And even, and it's not, and I think it's a deeper point that you're making is
[2159.79s - 2163.15s] you want to be able to see your story in someone, right?
[2163.23s - 2165.55s] Even just beyond like color and background.
[2165.55s - 2168.03s] It's like your story, your experience of life.
[2168.03s - 2170.99s] When we made Dear Basketball, we got a lot of pushback from people.
[2170.99s - 2175.07s] Like, oh, I took it to some very prominent studios at first.
[2175.87s - 2178.35s] And they all said, yeah, no.
[2179.63s - 2182.51s] Because you said basketball is too sport specific.
[2183.47s - 2185.23s] Nobody's going to connect with this sort of thing.
[2185.23s - 2188.19s] Because, you know, there's a lot of people out there who don't watch basketball.
[2188.19s - 2189.87s] And I'm like, well, that's not the point.
[2191.07s - 2191.95s] It's not the point.
[2191.95s - 2194.59s] And so it was really a case study, even with our novels.
[2194.59s - 2195.87s] Everybody was like, sports novels.
[2195.87s - 2196.75s] Nobody's going to read that.
[2196.75s - 2198.99s] It's too much of a niche market, niche market.
[2199.71s - 2201.87s] I'm like, sports is bigger than that, man.
[2201.87s - 2206.43s] And so we made Dear Basketball to really prove a point that you don't have to
[2206.43s - 2212.51s] watch basketball at all to connect to the journey of a dream, you know?
[2213.07s - 2218.59s] And once we saw that connection, it was kind of kind of validated our point of view.
[2218.59s - 2219.79s] I think that's a massive point of view.
[2219.79s - 2221.71s] And for anyone who's listening or watching right now who thinks,
[2222.27s - 2224.19s] because Kobe Bryant wants to do something, it just happens.
[2224.19s - 2225.95s] It just shows you have to do it yourself sometimes,
[2225.95s - 2227.95s] because not everyone's going to believe in you.
[2227.95s - 2228.75s] Certainly not.
[2228.75s - 2229.47s] Certainly not.
[2229.47s - 2232.67s] And what you'll see is, you know, once you start doing it,
[2232.67s - 2234.83s] and now people want to come and jump in.
[2234.83s - 2238.51s] But I'm like, you know, you kind of forced us to go about this ourselves.
[2238.51s - 2242.19s] So I think we're just going to build it from the ground up ourselves.
[2242.19s - 2242.99s] But thank you.
[2244.11s - 2245.23s] Exactly. They saved you.
[2245.23s - 2245.71s] Yeah.
[2245.71s - 2246.03s] Right.
[2246.03s - 2246.35s] Thank you.
[2246.35s - 2247.07s] But appreciate it.
[2247.07s - 2249.63s] Because if you had signed on, you know, we just get kind of
[2250.43s - 2251.23s] going with the flow.
[2251.23s - 2252.91s] Totally. Yeah. You can be grateful to them.
[2252.91s - 2254.03s] Yeah. Appreciate it.
[2254.03s - 2255.07s] Yeah. Absolutely. No, I agree.
[2255.07s - 2257.71s] It was the same with this podcast, funny enough, when we launched,
[2257.71s - 2261.39s] a lot of people were, a lot of people were considering whether it was, you know,
[2261.39s - 2263.23s] going to like, you know, you do social videos, like,
[2263.23s - 2264.43s] is it going to work on a podcast?
[2264.43s - 2266.19s] And there were a lot of people that were not sure.
[2266.19s - 2268.43s] And then like, we launched one of the biggest podcasts in the world
[2268.43s - 2270.75s] in the health category, which is, which is my world.
[2270.75s - 2272.83s] And it was just like, everyone was just like, oh, interesting.
[2272.83s - 2273.87s] But I'm like, thank you.
[2273.87s - 2274.19s] Yeah.
[2274.19s - 2275.95s] Like, thank you so much for saying no.
[2275.95s - 2279.23s] And you didn't think it was going to work because now I figured out myself.
[2279.23s - 2279.47s] Yes.
[2279.47s - 2282.67s] And what you said, it actually builds confidence and validation.
[2282.67s - 2287.15s] And Oprah told me this while I first decided to build the studio.
[2287.15s - 2288.91s] And I was asking how Harpo came to be.
[2289.79s - 2294.37s] And she said, well, when she was doing her deal for the Oprah Winfrey show,
[2294.93s - 2296.45s] she was re-upping her deal.
[2296.45s - 2299.73s] And actually the first contract she made, she said, well,
[2300.61s - 2301.73s] don't pay me up front.
[2302.37s - 2304.05s] Just I want to own a percentage of the show.
[2305.09s - 2306.37s] And so they gave it to her.
[2306.37s - 2310.77s] And now at the time, there weren't any black women hosting a daytime talk show.
[2310.77s - 2310.93s] Right.
[2310.93s - 2311.81s] So it was really new.
[2312.53s - 2317.25s] And she said, you know, Kobe, if they believe that the show is going to be successful,
[2317.25s - 2318.85s] they wouldn't have given me that.
[2320.53s - 2321.01s] They wouldn't.
[2321.01s - 2321.81s] They wouldn't have.
[2321.81s - 2323.57s] In their mind, they're thinking, oh, we got to steal.
[2323.57s - 2324.53s] We don't have to pay her.
[2324.53s - 2326.93s] We can take this money and move it over here.
[2326.93s - 2327.73s] This is great.
[2327.73s - 2329.97s] You know, it's going to be a flop or we succeed.
[2329.97s - 2330.29s] I don't know.
[2330.29s - 2331.81s] At least we get diversity on TV.
[2331.81s - 2332.61s] It's fine.
[2332.61s - 2334.77s] And all of a sudden it's, oh, uh-oh.
[2335.41s - 2337.57s] Uh-oh, we're in trouble.
[2338.37s - 2339.57s] We shouldn't have given it away.
[2339.57s - 2341.17s] Opened up Pandora's Box, right?
[2341.17s - 2342.77s] So now you come back for the next deal.
[2342.77s - 2345.33s] And it's like, you got to give me some more ownership.
[2345.33s - 2347.17s] They're like, dang it.
[2347.17s - 2347.65s] Here.
[2347.65s - 2351.09s] And then ultimately she, you know, came to only 100% of her show.
[2351.09s - 2351.49s] Yeah.
[2351.49s - 2352.29s] Which is amazing.
[2352.29s - 2352.53s] Wow.
[2352.53s - 2353.49s] That's a great story.
[2353.49s - 2353.73s] Yeah.
[2353.73s - 2354.45s] That's fascinating.
[2354.45s - 2356.85s] I think because sometimes when you think that you're like, oh, they like me.
[2356.85s - 2357.57s] That's why they're giving it.
[2357.57s - 2357.73s] No.
[2357.73s - 2358.13s] Yeah.
[2358.13s - 2358.29s] No.
[2358.93s - 2360.77s] Don't like me, please.
[2360.77s - 2361.65s] Here's an idea.
[2361.65s - 2362.85s] It's terrible.
[2362.85s - 2364.69s] I just need you to buy in just a little bit.
[2364.85s - 2366.61s] Yeah, I love that word.
[2366.61s - 2367.33s] That is awesome.
[2367.33s - 2371.57s] How are you encouraging, you've shared so many stories of like your teacher who taught you
[2371.57s - 2373.09s] about storytelling and writing early on.
[2373.09s - 2374.21s] You just shared an Oprah's example.
[2374.21s - 2376.77s] Like you've had so many incredible mentors in your life.
[2376.77s - 2378.29s] We all know about that.
[2378.29s - 2381.49s] How are you encouraging young people to find the right mentors?
[2381.49s - 2383.89s] And how can they find the right mentors even through your work?
[2383.89s - 2386.29s] I guess your work is somewhat mentorship.
[2386.29s - 2388.13s] Yeah, we try to be, you know.
[2388.13s - 2390.53s] And I think the important thing is research.
[2391.25s - 2394.93s] You know, in the hall here in the office, I have a hall that I call Muse Hall.
[2395.81s - 2401.41s] We have all the portraits of some of our muses here from J.K. Rowling to, you know,
[2401.41s - 2403.57s] Steve Jobs and so forth and so on.
[2403.57s - 2405.25s] And I think it's important to research them.
[2405.97s - 2409.97s] And it's like putting fuel in the fire every day.
[2409.97s - 2413.73s] It's constant inspiration when you read about them, what they were able to accomplish,
[2413.73s - 2415.73s] how they went about accomplishing it.
[2415.73s - 2421.49s] You're just constantly, you know, feeding that flame and learning.
[2421.49s - 2424.85s] And the best way to do that is to learn from the people who have done it.
[2424.85s - 2425.73s] Yes.
[2425.73s - 2426.77s] That just made me so happy.
[2426.77s - 2428.29s] I have a gallery wall in my home.
[2428.29s - 2431.01s] If we were recording this at my place in Hollywood,
[2431.01s - 2433.09s] like I have a gallery wall, Steve Jobs is right there.
[2433.09s - 2433.57s] Yeah, yeah.
[2433.57s - 2433.81s] Right.
[2433.81s - 2435.89s] And Einstein's there.
[2435.89s - 2436.85s] And Martin Luther King's there.
[2436.85s - 2437.65s] And there's a few other people.
[2437.65s - 2439.17s] And it's, for me, it's the same thing.
[2439.17s - 2440.85s] It's like sometimes I'm sitting there and I'll be like,
[2440.85s - 2441.89s] well, what would that person do?
[2441.89s - 2443.73s] Like how would they have dealt with this challenge?
[2443.73s - 2444.45s] And you're so right.
[2444.45s - 2447.81s] I think you can be mentored by people who aren't alive.
[2447.81s - 2448.77s] 100 percent.
[2448.77s - 2452.85s] And their story still live, which brings us to the importance of storytelling.
[2452.85s - 2453.89s] Their story still live.
[2453.89s - 2455.17s] These muses are here.
[2455.17s - 2456.69s] It's important to learn from them.
[2457.33s - 2461.97s] And if anything, it helps you remember that they are human, just like us.
[2463.01s - 2468.05s] These great things that get accomplished can be accomplished by others and beyond.
[2468.85s - 2472.13s] You know, building Walt Disney Company is not something that, you know,
[2472.21s - 2474.45s] people look at and scoff at and go, oh, it can't be done.
[2474.45s - 2475.49s] Well, why not?
[2476.32s - 2477.12s] Why not?
[2477.12s - 2477.68s] Yeah.
[2477.68s - 2480.08s] And the more action you take, the more you think it's possible.
[2480.08s - 2480.56s] Yeah.
[2480.56s - 2482.64s] Because you realize they're people just like us.
[2482.64s - 2484.64s] They make mistakes just like us.
[2484.64s - 2485.76s] And they kept going.
[2486.32s - 2488.24s] And we can do the same.
[2488.24s - 2488.96s] Absolutely, man.
[2488.96s - 2491.84s] Well, I could talk to you for hours about you're a busy man
[2491.84s - 2492.80s] and you got loads of things to do.
[2492.80s - 2495.84s] So we end every interview with what we call the final five,
[2495.84s - 2497.04s] quick fire, rapid fire round,
[2497.04s - 2500.56s] which means you have to answer in one word or one sentence maximum.
[2500.56s - 2500.96s] Got it.
[2500.96s - 2502.40s] So this is easy for you.
[2502.40s - 2505.92s] So the first question is, what brings you the most joy right now?
[2507.98s - 2508.38s] Family.
[2509.02s - 2509.58s] Beautiful.
[2509.58s - 2512.46s] Second, what do you want your girls to think when they hear your name?
[2514.37s - 2514.69s] Daddy.
[2515.41s - 2515.97s] Nice.
[2515.97s - 2518.13s] Number three, your favorite animated film?

[2519.73s - 2520.69s] Oh, nice.
[2520.69s - 2521.89s] Oh, I was not expecting that.
[2521.89s - 2523.25s] It's the greatest.
[2523.25s - 2523.49s] Yeah.
[2523.49s - 2526.69s] They made, I mean, they were in a zone when they made that film.
[2526.69s - 2527.25s] Absolutely.
[2527.25s - 2529.89s] Question number four, the book that's had the biggest impact on you?
