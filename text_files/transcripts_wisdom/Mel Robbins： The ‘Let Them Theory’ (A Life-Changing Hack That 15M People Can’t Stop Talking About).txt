[0.00s - 4.64s] Every human being has a hard-wired need to be in control of everything.
[4.64s - 6.72s] There's three things in your control, Jay.
[6.72s - 10.72s] What you think, what you do or don't do, and how you process your emotions.
[10.72s - 13.60s] If you embrace this skill, you're going to be shocked.
[13.60s - 18.64s] This is by far one of the best self-hope books I've ever read.
[18.64s - 21.44s] Your mind and soul are in for a treat.
[21.44s - 28.24s] The queen of grounded science-facts personal development, Mel Robbins.
[28.32s - 32.56s] Work has been seen as the number one cause of stress.
[32.56s - 34.24s] You have a customer that's really rude.
[34.24s - 35.52s] You lose a big account.
[35.52s - 37.04s] You get passed over for something.
[37.04s - 41.12s] As you notice the stress come up, Jay, you're simply going to say, let them.
[41.12s - 47.12s] If you focus and try to manage things that are never going to be within your control,
[47.12s - 51.28s] it only creates stress, anxiety, and frustration for you.
[51.28s - 56.16s] Imagine for every thought you had about that person, you had to pay them a dollar.
[56.16s - 59.84s] That's how much energy time and money is being wasted.
[59.84s - 65.92s] You have no idea right now how much time and energy is being wasted or drained because of
[65.92s - 69.92s] other people's behavior or your expectations about how you wish things would go.
[70.80s - 72.72s] This is, I think, my legacy.
[73.36s - 78.56s] I think that this is the thing I was supposed to figure out and leave the world.
[79.52s - 94.86s] If you're struggling right now with things you can't control, this episode is for you.
[94.86s - 99.34s] If you're someone who's struggling at work and negative people in toxic culture,
[99.34s - 100.46s] this episode's for you.
[100.46s - 104.06s] If you're someone who's struggling with your family members and your friends and
[104.06s - 105.82s] setting boundaries, this episode's for you.
[105.82s - 112.38s] So, Mel, where I want to start is work has been seen as the number one cause of stress.
[112.38s - 114.94s] You write about this in the book in people's lives.
[115.50s - 121.34s] How can the let them theory help people in the place that causes them the most stress?
[121.34s - 122.38s] It's an excellent question.
[122.38s - 127.26s] So first, let me, no pun intended, let me explain the theory.
[127.26s - 131.82s] So in case you haven't bumped into this online, the theory is very simple.
[132.38s - 138.22s] It is a mindset tool that instantly helps you identify what's in your control and what's not
[138.22s - 138.86s] in your control.
[139.42s - 146.14s] The reason why this is important is because any psychologist will tell you that if you focus
[146.14s - 150.30s] and try to manage things that are never going to be within your control,
[150.30s - 154.30s] it only creates stress, anxiety, and frustration for you.
[155.18s - 160.78s] When you take the context of work, there is so much inside your day-to-day life at work
[160.78s - 166.62s] that is irritating, it is stressful, it is annoying from the endless meetings and no time
[166.62s - 171.50s] to get work done to if you're somebody that is working in a retail store, you're doing shift work,
[171.50s - 176.46s] you don't have control over what shifts you get to feeling like you don't have the chance for
[176.46s - 178.30s] promotion, it is just endless.
[178.86s - 184.30s] And the way that you're going to use the let them theory is anytime something is happening at work
[184.30s - 188.06s] that stresses you out, you have a customer that's really rude, you lose a big account,
[188.06s - 191.82s] you get passed over for something, your idea gets dismissed in a work meeting.
[192.38s - 196.38s] As you notice the stress come up, Jay, you're simply going to say, let them.
[197.31s - 204.11s] Let my boss be in a bad mood, let my colleague take credit, let the customer be rude to me.
[204.11s - 208.03s] And here's the thing, this sounds almost like you're being a doormat and you're being passive,
[208.03s - 209.07s] it's the exact opposite.
[209.79s - 217.47s] When you say let them, you're recognizing that the situation right now that has just happened
[217.47s - 223.63s] has already happened and that there is no reason to allow it to stress you out.
[223.63s - 227.63s] When you allow your boss's mood to stress you out or make you nervous, you're giving
[227.63s - 231.23s] power to your boss that they do not deserve.
[231.23s - 232.91s] And so you're going to say, let them.
[233.79s - 239.71s] When you allow a customer that is rude or inconsiderate to make you feel bad about yourself
[239.71s - 245.71s] or to make you upset or to rattle you, you just gave this rude person power over you.
[245.71s - 248.99s] When you say let them, something interesting happens.
[248.99s - 249.95s] First of all, you detach.
[250.91s - 254.43s] Second, you feel almost superior.
[254.43s - 257.63s] It's this weird thing because I don't think this is the same thing as saying let it go.
[258.62s - 261.18s] You're a very grounded person, Jay.
[261.82s - 264.46s] You strike me as the kind of person that can let anything go.
[265.58s - 270.30s] Me, whenever somebody would say to me, Mel, I know, I know it's not fair what just happened
[270.30s - 271.18s] at work, you got to let it go.
[271.18s - 273.34s] I'd be like, but I feel like I lost.
[273.34s - 276.54s] I feel like I now have to be defeated.
[276.54s - 279.90s] I feel more like a doormat if somebody tells me to let something go.
[279.90s - 283.10s] What's the difference between let it go and let them?
[283.10s - 287.90s] For me, when I say let them, I get a jolt of superiority because I'm like,
[287.90s - 291.26s] I can see that my boss is kind of a jerk and I'm just going to let them be a jerk.
[291.90s - 294.62s] And I rise above it and I feel a little judgy.
[294.62s - 297.74s] I mean, if I'm being perfectly honest, I mean, this is why people get this tattooed on their
[297.74s - 298.54s] bodies.
[298.54s - 302.38s] Because when you say the word let them or you see it on your arm,
[303.02s - 308.30s] what happens is you no longer allowed a rude colleague or something frustrating at work
[308.30s - 309.26s] to derail your day.
[310.05s - 314.29s] You say, let them and you rise above it and you kind of go, I see what's happening here.
[314.29s - 316.77s] I'm going to allow this without allowing it.
[317.33s - 318.69s] But then there's a second part, Jay.
[318.69s - 324.61s] And this is the most important part and it's the part that people do not tattoo on themselves
[324.61s - 326.53s] because it's the harder part.
[327.25s - 332.29s] And the second part of this theory is saying to yourself, let me remind myself that
[332.29s - 334.77s] in life, there are always three things I can control.
[334.77s - 335.65s] That's where my power is.
[335.65s - 343.89s] My power is not in managing my boss or in trying to deal with some customer that just
[343.89s - 349.33s] doesn't want to be in an okay mood and doesn't want to be calmed down.
[349.33s - 350.37s] They want to be right.
[350.37s - 351.65s] They want to take it out on you.
[351.65s - 352.45s] So you're going to let them.
[353.01s - 355.97s] But then you've created this boundary, you rise above.
[355.97s - 357.17s] I'm going to just let you be upset here.
[357.17s - 358.45s] I'm not going to let it impact me.
[358.45s - 359.49s] And then you say, let me.
[360.21s - 363.57s] And what you're reminding yourself of is there's three things in your control, Jay.
[363.57s - 366.72s] What you think next, what you do or don't do.
[367.28s - 369.84s] And oftentimes not doing something is the more powerful mood.
[371.28s - 373.76s] And how you process your emotions.
[374.93s - 377.17s] Those are the three things that are always in your control.
[377.89s - 384.30s] And when you say, let me take responsibility right now for how I'm going to respond to this.
[384.30s - 387.26s] And the word responsibility, after all, is the ability to respond.
[387.50s - 389.90s] Right? And so when you say, let me.
[390.86s - 393.82s] And you remember, I can think what I want about this.
[393.82s - 395.74s] I can act in response to this.
[395.74s - 399.50s] And I can process my emotions and either allow them to rise and fall
[400.59s - 402.03s] and stay steady and calm.
[402.03s - 406.11s] Or you can certainly erupt if you want to.
[406.11s - 407.47s] But why would you want to?
[407.47s - 410.67s] Because then that means you've given power to somebody else.
[410.67s - 417.07s] Why are we so distracted and obsessed with things we can't control?
[417.07s - 420.19s] I'm sure we all have a friend or know someone
[420.19s - 423.31s] who knows they need to be working on their business.
[423.31s - 425.23s] But they're talking about the news.
[425.23s - 427.47s] They know they should be writing their book,
[427.47s - 429.95s] but they're focused on talking about politics.
[429.95s - 433.63s] They know they should be building the next stage in their career
[433.63s - 436.27s] or whatever it may be, trying to get that promotion,
[436.27s - 439.47s] work towards that next threshold or whatever they're trying to achieve.
[439.47s - 442.83s] But they're distracted by talking about all the people,
[442.83s - 446.27s] all the things, all the ideas that they can do nothing about.
[446.27s - 448.27s] Why are we so addicted to it?
[448.27s - 450.67s] Well, I think there's two reasons,
[450.67s - 452.67s] because your question is about two different things.
[452.67s - 455.39s] One is, why are we focused on things we can't control?
[455.39s - 457.87s] And the other one is sort of like, why are we distracted?
[457.87s - 459.39s] And they're interconnected.
[459.39s - 461.87s] So let's just address the issue of control.
[462.99s - 468.06s] Every human being has a hard-wired need to be in control of everything.
[468.70s - 471.74s] Because being in control is what makes you feel safe.
[471.74s - 475.02s] So I need to feel in control of my thoughts,
[475.02s - 477.74s] my decisions, my environment, my future.
[478.38s - 480.62s] And the problem is, so do you.
[480.62s - 485.42s] But part of the need for control, Jay, extends beyond me,
[486.06s - 490.38s] because if you're doing something that makes me annoyed or irritated
[490.38s - 494.70s] or worried about you, now I'm feeling a little unsafe or worried
[494.70s - 495.74s] because of what you're doing.
[495.74s - 499.02s] And so now I'm going to want to control you so that I feel better.
[499.66s - 503.98s] And so it is a fundamental hard-wired need
[503.98s - 507.98s] inside every human being you know to be in control of yourself.
[508.70s - 512.14s] And yet, the second we step across the line
[512.14s - 513.90s] and we try to control someone else,
[513.90s - 515.74s] whether it's, I think you should be healthier,
[515.74s - 517.42s] I think you should be more motivated,
[517.42s - 520.38s] I wish you wouldn't like leave the Kleenexes
[520.38s - 521.90s] when you're blowing your nose on the couch,
[521.90s - 523.98s] whatever it is that you wish someone else would do.
[523.98s - 526.22s] I wish my boss wouldn't talk in every meeting
[526.22s - 528.06s] and would give a chance like for us to talk.
[528.78s - 531.66s] All of that desire for someone else to change
[531.66s - 534.06s] is you attempting to control the uncontrollable.
[534.70s - 537.98s] And so I think one of the reasons why we do this
[537.98s - 539.74s] is because we're hard-wired to do it.
[539.74s - 544.14s] And the problem becomes that the second I try to control you, Jay,
[544.14s - 546.62s] it's not going to motivate you to do what I want you to do.
[546.62s - 549.90s] It's going to bump up against your need for your own control.
[549.90s - 551.26s] So you're going to push back against me.
[551.26s - 552.22s] Absolutely.
[552.22s - 554.78s] And so you also asked about distraction.
[554.78s - 557.42s] I think the reason why we're so distracted
[557.42s - 560.62s] is because if you spend so much time and energy
[560.62s - 564.30s] allowing the world around you to stress you out and drain your energy,
[565.18s - 568.38s] you are now susceptible to being hijacked
[568.38s - 571.82s] by meaningless things that are not important to you.
[571.82s - 574.38s] And this is one of the biggest discoveries that I've made
[574.38s - 575.90s] about using the let them theory
[575.90s - 578.22s] and researching it has spread around the world
[578.22s - 580.30s] is that the single biggest benefit
[580.86s - 582.78s] is that you get time and energy back.
[582.78s - 585.74s] You have no idea right now how much time and energy
[586.30s - 588.46s] is being wasted or drained
[588.46s - 591.58s] because of other people's behavior or your expectations
[591.58s - 593.50s] about how you wish things would go.
[593.50s - 598.32s] And once you start noticing all of these little moments all day long,
[598.32s - 599.84s] it's like a death by a thousand cuts.
[599.84s - 600.96s] You want to know why you're too tired?
[600.96s - 602.16s] You want to know why you're overwhelmed?
[602.16s - 603.36s] You want to know why you're stressed out?
[603.36s - 605.92s] You want to know why you have no time for yourself?
[605.92s - 608.88s] It's because of the power you give to other people's opinions,
[608.88s - 611.28s] their emotions, their immature behavior.
[611.28s - 616.00s] It's the ways in which you are turning people into a problem in your life.
[616.00s - 617.76s] And here's the sad fact.
[617.76s - 622.64s] The sad fact is other people should be the greatest source
[623.52s - 626.72s] of happiness and connection and inspiration.
[627.36s - 631.60s] But if you don't truly learn this skill
[631.60s - 632.88s] that we're going to talk about today,
[633.60s - 636.72s] of focusing on what you can control
[636.72s - 639.76s] and letting people be who they are,
[640.82s - 643.46s] letting things play out as they're playing out,
[643.46s - 646.10s] and then bringing the power back in-house
[646.10s - 648.26s] and really focusing on how you respond to it.
[648.26s - 651.30s] If you embrace this skill, you're going to be shocked.
[651.30s - 654.26s] You're going to be shocked by how much time you've wasted.
[654.90s - 655.94s] I'm not kidding.
[655.94s - 657.94s] And you're going to be shocked, Jay,
[657.94s - 661.14s] by the fact that you've allowed stupid things
[661.94s - 665.46s] and people's drama to drain you.
[666.42s - 670.58s] And that's why I also think we're so susceptible to distraction
[670.58s - 674.58s] because we've given so much power away all day long.
[674.66s - 675.54s] Because here's the truth.
[675.54s - 676.34s] Like I'll give you an example.
[676.34s - 679.14s] When I first discovered this and I started playing around with it,
[679.14s - 681.78s] the very first way that I used it after I discovered it
[681.78s - 682.90s] was I was standing in line.
[683.70s - 685.78s] And we've all been at the grocery store
[685.78s - 689.38s] when it's like six people deep and there's one person working.
[689.38s - 691.86s] I was like, beep, beep, beep.
[691.86s - 694.50s] And you start feeling that wave, right?
[695.22s - 698.42s] And immediately the wave of stress takes over
[698.42s - 700.74s] because you're now irritated by what's happening.
[701.38s - 705.38s] And what just happens when you start reacting to that
[705.94s - 708.98s] and you allow that stress wave to start to take over
[709.54s - 712.50s] is that you're giving power to something outside of you.
[712.50s - 716.48s] Now, I can't control what's happening right now.
[716.48s - 720.72s] So why on earth would I allow it to drain my energy?
[720.72s - 723.28s] Because as it comes up, Jay, what do I then do?
[723.28s - 725.76s] I then start talking to myself, well, this is ridiculous.
[725.76s - 727.28s] Why have they not done an announcement?
[727.28s - 728.80s] Like I got to get going here.
[729.20s - 731.12s] Why are they not bringing another?
[731.12s - 732.72s] Now I'm starting to believe, Jay,
[732.72s - 735.04s] that I can run a supermarket better than the people
[735.04s - 736.00s] that are running it.
[736.00s - 738.08s] And then you, of course, turn to the person behind you
[738.08s - 739.84s] and you're like, can you believe this?
[739.84s - 744.14s] And now this is the interesting part
[744.14s - 745.82s] that I really want everybody,
[746.46s - 748.30s] I really want the person listening to embrace.
[749.74s - 753.50s] In that moment, you just gave away your energy
[755.01s - 756.13s] and you have a choice.
[757.49s - 761.84s] When you say, let them, you instantly feel a release
[762.91s - 766.43s] and then you say, let me decide what I'm going to do right now.
[766.43s - 766.99s] Am I going to leave?
[766.99s - 767.95s] I can leave the store.
[769.10s - 770.30s] That's one thing I can do.
[770.30s - 772.86s] I could stand here and practice being present.
[773.54s - 774.82s] That's another thing I could do.
[774.82s - 777.22s] I could, because I don't have time at the end of the day
[777.22s - 779.30s] and I'm always tired and I'm complaining that I'm lonely,
[779.30s - 781.22s] I could actually pick up the phone and call my grandmother.
[782.16s - 783.68s] I could text my friend Jay Shetty
[784.32s - 785.36s] because I've been thinking about him.
[785.92s - 788.08s] Like you have so much power,
[788.80s - 790.64s] but you're going to burn through it in that line
[791.20s - 793.60s] and then you're going to feel your stress activated
[793.60s - 794.80s] and then you're going to get in the car
[794.80s - 796.56s] and then somebody's going to pull out in front of you
[796.56s - 798.64s] and then you're going to be stressed again
[798.64s - 800.48s] and then you're going to walk into work
[800.48s - 802.08s] and you're going to be annoyed in some meeting
[802.08s - 804.48s] because of what somebody said
[804.48s - 806.40s] and then that's going to hit you again
[806.40s - 810.64s] and all day long because you don't recognize
[810.64s - 812.00s] how this stuff is impacting you,
[812.56s - 815.36s] that energy inside your body is slowly draining
[816.00s - 818.08s] and this is why you're exhausted
[818.08s - 820.16s] and so simply starting to use it,
[820.16s - 823.12s] whether it's at work or it's just in your daily life
[823.68s - 824.80s] to say let them.
[825.44s - 828.24s] Wanting people to change is not the problem.
[828.24s - 829.92s] How we go about it is,
[829.92s - 831.92s] if their behavior is telling you
[831.92s - 834.80s] that your needs are not a priority,
[835.86s - 837.78s] you have to let them reveal that.
[837.78s - 839.38s] You're only attached to it
[839.38s - 842.90s] because you've never experienced anything else.
[842.90s - 844.18s] I want to paint another scenario
[844.18s - 846.10s] for people to really understand the system.
[846.10s - 849.06s] Let's say you have a partner, boyfriend, girlfriend,
[849.06s - 850.10s] maybe you're married to them
[850.66s - 854.90s] and this person always turns up from work a little bit late.
[855.46s - 857.78s] They don't wash the dishes, you wake up in the morning,
[857.78s - 859.54s] the dishes are always still out there.
[860.42s - 864.66s] There's a sense that you've told them this irks you a million times.
[864.66s - 867.06s] Did my husband ask you to ask me this question, Jay?
[868.02s - 869.14s] Jay.
[869.14s - 869.86s] He's amazing.
[869.86s - 873.06s] Oh no, Chris has your number, so I probably texted you.
[874.18s - 877.22s] Yeah, and so, I mean, I'm speaking from so much,
[877.22s - 878.74s] not direct personal experience,
[878.74s - 880.74s] but personal experience in so many ways
[880.74s - 883.70s] and you're saying this person's not changing,
[883.70s - 884.82s] they haven't changed for like a few three years.
[884.82s - 886.34s] Because this is a fundamental rule, everybody.
[886.98s - 889.06s] Number one, you cannot change another human being.
[889.06s - 891.46s] It is impossible for you to change somebody else.
[891.46s - 895.52s] Now, you can influence them, but you cannot change them.
[896.08s - 899.44s] People only change if they feel like it and if they can.
[900.54s - 903.66s] And wanting and wishing is a wonderful thing.
[903.66s - 905.98s] Wanting and wishing somebody to be cleaner
[905.98s - 907.66s] and to pick up after themselves,
[907.66s - 909.82s] wanting your kids to be more motivated,
[909.82s - 911.42s] wanting the people that you love
[911.42s - 912.78s] to take better care of themselves
[912.78s - 914.62s] and to be healthier or to date somebody
[914.62s - 916.14s] that is normal and healthy
[916.14s - 918.78s] instead of the losers that treat them like crap.
[918.78s - 923.02s] That's a beautiful thing for you to want for other people
[923.02s - 925.34s] and you deserve to do that and you should do that.
[925.42s - 927.98s] Wanting people to change is not the problem.
[928.78s - 931.42s] Wanting bigger possibilities for people is not the problem.
[931.42s - 932.70s] How we go about it is.
[933.26s - 935.26s] And so in the scenario that you're talking about,
[935.26s - 936.70s] this is a beautiful example,
[937.50s - 940.78s] because you have to say, let them.
[941.50s - 943.10s] You see the dishes in the sink,
[943.10s - 945.74s] it makes you upset because you feel disrespected
[945.74s - 947.18s] and that it's annoying
[947.18s - 949.58s] and you have higher standards for cleanliness,
[949.58s - 951.58s] which means you're probably just going to do them anyway
[951.58s - 953.74s] and then you're going to feel like you're really taken
[953.74s - 955.10s] whatever for granted.
[955.10s - 956.70s] But you have to say, let them.
[957.42s - 959.98s] And one of the reasons why is because,
[961.02s - 964.78s] number one, if this is a long-term committed partnership,
[965.74s - 967.82s] learning how to love somebody as they are
[969.10s - 971.82s] is a form of love that is deeply important.
[972.64s - 977.28s] And if you can't say let them in that moment,
[977.92s - 980.08s] you are going to get frustrated and angry
[980.64s - 982.96s] and then you are going to come to the next part
[982.96s - 985.92s] of the let them theory with tremendous intensity
[985.92s - 987.12s] and judgment.
[987.12s - 989.28s] And that's not going to motivate change.
[989.28s - 991.36s] What it does when you judge somebody
[991.36s - 992.72s] or you push against them
[992.72s - 995.44s] is it actually creates resistance to change.
[996.32s - 998.00s] So you have to say let them
[998.00s - 1001.68s] because it allows you to detach from your emotions
[1001.68s - 1003.36s] and detach from judgment, right?
[1003.92s - 1004.80s] It is what it is.
[1004.80s - 1005.84s] I see what's happened.
[1005.84s - 1007.60s] I'm accepting the reality of this.
[1007.60s - 1008.48s] Let them.
[1008.48s - 1009.84s] Then you come to the let me part.
[1010.72s - 1012.64s] Is this something that bothers you?
[1012.72s - 1015.28s] And if it is, remember, you got three things.
[1015.84s - 1017.44s] I can choose what I want to think about this.
[1017.44s - 1019.20s] And so you could think a good thought.
[1019.20s - 1020.96s] You could think, okay, good intention.
[1020.96s - 1022.80s] They were probably super busy this morning
[1022.80s - 1024.24s] and they meant to do it later.
[1024.24s - 1025.20s] Let them, okay?
[1025.20s - 1026.48s] I'm going to choose to believe that.
[1027.28s - 1029.36s] You could also then remind yourself,
[1029.36s - 1030.48s] let me remind myself,
[1030.48s - 1032.80s] there's something I can do about this, right?
[1032.80s - 1033.92s] And if it's really important,
[1033.92s - 1036.40s] what you need to do about this is have a conversation.
[1036.40s - 1038.32s] And by the way, Chris has had this conversation
[1038.32s - 1039.92s] with me a bazillion times.
[1039.92s - 1041.44s] So if you walk into our bathroom,
[1042.00s - 1045.52s] Chris's bathroom probably looks like your side of the sink,
[1045.52s - 1048.80s] which is it's like a Zen seven star hotel J.
[1048.80s - 1052.32s] Like there's not a spec on that man's like basin
[1052.32s - 1053.60s] or whatever you call it.
[1053.60s - 1054.88s] If you look at mine,
[1055.52s - 1058.48s] it looks like somebody tipped over a Walgreens aisle
[1058.48s - 1060.00s] on top of that thing.
[1060.00s - 1062.24s] And it drives Chris crazy.
[1062.24s - 1063.92s] But what particularly drives him crazy
[1063.92s - 1066.48s] is when something migrates from my side to his side, right?
[1066.48s - 1067.36s] And so he's asked me,
[1067.36s - 1069.76s] he's asked me to please keep my stuff over there.
[1069.76s - 1072.00s] He has asked me to please flatten cardboard boxes
[1072.00s - 1074.48s] when they come in, don't unpack them
[1074.48s - 1076.32s] and then stack them by the garage door
[1076.32s - 1077.44s] as if I'm supposed to do it.
[1078.08s - 1079.60s] And he's asked me and asked me and asked me
[1079.60s - 1080.48s] and then I forget.
[1081.12s - 1082.72s] Well, he finally sat me down, Jay.
[1083.50s - 1084.54s] And this is the let me part.
[1084.54s - 1086.22s] You have to take responsibility
[1086.22s - 1088.62s] for explaining to somebody what you need.
[1089.55s - 1092.43s] And the reason why this is important to you.
[1092.43s - 1094.59s] Because when Chris said to me,
[1094.59s - 1096.51s] I know you don't intend this,
[1097.23s - 1099.07s] but this is the impact now.
[1099.07s - 1101.23s] When I see the cardboard boxes stacked
[1101.23s - 1104.19s] or I see your hairbrush and 15 products
[1104.19s - 1106.27s] of yours on my countertop,
[1107.39s - 1110.83s] it actually makes me feel like you think I'm the main.
[1112.11s - 1113.15s] And we don't even have a maid.
[1113.15s - 1116.27s] Like it's just like it makes me feel
[1116.27s - 1119.95s] like you think it's my job to clean up after you.
[1120.77s - 1122.29s] And that doesn't make me feel loved.
[1123.09s - 1125.81s] Now, when he took the time in a very calm way
[1125.81s - 1127.25s] to drop into his values
[1127.25s - 1129.01s] and communicate what he needed,
[1130.08s - 1131.28s] something interesting happens.
[1131.84s - 1133.84s] If you're in a committed loving partnership
[1133.84s - 1136.00s] and you're with somebody who wants to do better
[1136.00s - 1136.96s] and cares about you,
[1138.03s - 1140.59s] it taps into their intrinsic motivation
[1141.79s - 1143.15s] to build new skills.
[1144.90s - 1147.38s] If you have that kind of conversation with somebody
[1148.32s - 1150.72s] and you explain how their behavior impacts you,
[1150.72s - 1151.68s] whether it's their drinking
[1152.32s - 1154.64s] or it's the tone of their voice
[1154.64s - 1156.72s] or it's the fact that they leave their stuff everywhere
[1156.72s - 1159.12s] or it's that they insist that you spend every
[1159.12s - 1160.40s] holiday with their family
[1160.40s - 1162.72s] and they have no interest in whatever the issue is.
[1162.72s - 1163.92s] If you sit somebody down
[1163.92s - 1164.96s] and you take responsibility,
[1164.96s - 1166.56s] you've let them be
[1166.56s - 1168.32s] and you've let them show you who they are
[1169.15s - 1169.79s] and then you say,
[1169.79s - 1171.39s] let me sit down and talk about this
[1171.39s - 1172.35s] and take responsibility.
[1172.35s - 1173.79s] I have the ability to respond to this
[1173.79s - 1175.15s] like a mature adult.
[1175.15s - 1177.79s] And you actually express what you need and why
[1177.79s - 1179.79s] and that person doesn't try.
[1181.49s - 1182.53s] You have to let them.
[1182.53s - 1183.17s] And here's why.
[1183.97s - 1186.45s] Their behavior is telling you the truth.
[1187.44s - 1190.08s] Their behavior is telling you
[1190.08s - 1191.20s] what they care about
[1191.20s - 1192.56s] and what their priorities are.
[1193.20s - 1195.36s] And if their behavior is telling you
[1195.36s - 1198.24s] that your needs are not a priority,
[1199.33s - 1201.17s] you have to let them reveal that.
[1201.17s - 1202.77s] That's also what let them be.
[1202.77s - 1203.17s] Yes.
[1203.81s - 1205.17s] Because then you're going to come back
[1205.17s - 1206.13s] to the second part,
[1206.99s - 1209.31s] which is let me ask myself,
[1210.19s - 1213.07s] is this kind of behavior from somebody
[1213.95s - 1215.87s] what I deserve?
[1216.91s - 1221.15s] Is this what I'm willing to accept in somebody?
[1221.15s - 1221.71s] Because again,
[1221.71s - 1222.51s] what do we also know?
[1222.51s - 1224.59s] People only change when they want to or they can.
[1225.98s - 1227.98s] And you might be in a situation
[1228.54s - 1230.70s] where somebody would really love to change,
[1230.70s - 1232.66s] but they can't
[1233.30s - 1236.50s] because they're dealing with some challenge right now
[1236.50s - 1238.50s] or they don't have the skill yet.
[1239.14s - 1241.06s] And you may decide,
[1241.06s - 1242.02s] if that's the case,
[1242.74s - 1244.50s] to still love and accept the person.
[1244.50s - 1244.98s] Right.
[1244.98s - 1245.38s] Right?
[1245.38s - 1245.70s] Yeah.
[1245.70s - 1247.46s] But there may be times where
[1248.02s - 1249.46s] you have had the conversation
[1250.40s - 1252.64s] and it is very clear they're capable of it.
[1252.64s - 1253.76s] They just won't do it.
[1253.76s - 1254.40s] Yeah.
[1254.40s - 1256.56s] And what I find in relationships
[1256.56s - 1258.72s] where that sort of invisible distance
[1258.72s - 1260.88s] and the frustration and the resentment comes up
[1260.88s - 1261.60s] is twofold.
[1261.60s - 1262.16s] Number one,
[1263.76s - 1265.84s] you can't detach from your emotions
[1265.84s - 1268.00s] and say let them and really fully
[1268.00s - 1269.92s] just let the person be who they are.
[1269.92s - 1271.04s] And you don't do the part,
[1271.04s - 1273.44s] let me where you actually take responsibility
[1273.44s - 1275.68s] for expressing in a mature way
[1275.68s - 1278.56s] what you need and how their behavior impacts you.
[1278.56s - 1280.40s] And so if you don't ever express what you need
[1280.40s - 1281.44s] and how it's impacting you,
[1281.44s - 1284.00s] you're not actually giving somebody the opportunity
[1284.00s - 1284.80s] to build a skill
[1285.44s - 1287.68s] or to change or to love you the way that you need them
[1288.40s - 1290.72s] to love you so that you feel loved.
[1291.28s - 1294.00s] The second mistake that I see constantly
[1294.00s - 1296.53s] is that you make the ask
[1297.33s - 1299.65s] and then the person doesn't do it.
[1299.65s - 1302.69s] And then you start making excuses
[1303.33s - 1304.61s] and resentment builds.
[1305.33s - 1308.21s] And you stay in something seeing exactly
[1308.21s - 1310.29s] who someone is wishing they would change
[1310.29s - 1312.69s] living up here in your mind about the fantasy
[1312.69s - 1313.89s] of what you wish this was
[1314.61s - 1318.45s] refusing to accept the reality of what it actually is.
[1319.01s - 1321.25s] You've just unlocked a whole new meaning
[1321.81s - 1323.09s] of let them for me.
[1323.09s - 1323.65s] How so?
[1323.65s - 1325.09s] I've always understood let them
[1325.09s - 1326.21s] when I've heard you speak about it
[1326.21s - 1326.93s] when I read the book,
[1326.93s - 1329.57s] this idea of let them be who they are.
[1329.57s - 1331.57s] Let them act the way they want to act.
[1331.57s - 1333.81s] Let them say and do whatever they want to do.
[1333.81s - 1334.53s] I have to let them.
[1334.53s - 1336.29s] I have to keep that distance.
[1336.29s - 1337.81s] What you just unlocked for me,
[1337.81s - 1340.93s] which I really want everyone to grapple with
[1340.93s - 1342.77s] because I think it's so powerful,
[1342.77s - 1345.97s] is this idea of let them also show you who they are.
[1346.61s - 1348.53s] And if they're showing you who they are,
[1348.53s - 1351.41s] let them be that person.
[1351.41s - 1353.81s] Don't make them the person you imagine them to be,
[1353.81s - 1354.85s] the one you want them to be,
[1354.85s - 1356.85s] the one that you're wishing and waiting
[1356.85s - 1358.05s] and hoping for them to be.
[1358.05s - 1359.25s] They are that person.
[1359.81s - 1360.45s] Let them be.
[1360.45s - 1361.49s] That is, oh my gosh,
[1361.49s - 1365.01s] my mind is literally blown because that is so powerful.
[1365.01s - 1366.29s] But you still have power, Jay.
[1366.29s - 1367.97s] That here's the most important thing, everybody.
[1368.61s - 1369.89s] This is the most important thing.
[1369.89s - 1371.81s] This is the epiphany that I had too.
[1372.85s - 1375.82s] Like, holy cow, I still get to choose.
[1377.25s - 1378.85s] I still get to choose.
[1378.85s - 1381.73s] I get to choose how much time and energy I pour into this,
[1381.73s - 1385.04s] whether it's this issue or it's this topic
[1385.04s - 1386.08s] or it's this person.
[1387.20s - 1389.12s] And here's how you know
[1390.08s - 1392.80s] if you can actually love somebody
[1393.44s - 1395.68s] for who they are and who they're not.
[1396.40s - 1398.56s] Can you end your complaining and bitching about it?
[1399.50s - 1400.94s] Because if you can't do that,
[1400.94s - 1402.94s] then this is something you're holding onto
[1402.94s - 1404.38s] and you're holding over the other person.
[1405.50s - 1407.02s] And if they're never going to change,
[1407.02s - 1407.98s] you're going to have a problem.
[1409.02s - 1410.22s] Because the only thing that's going to make
[1410.22s - 1411.66s] the relationship better
[1411.66s - 1416.14s] is either them hearing you and caring enough
[1416.14s - 1419.42s] and being able to adjust
[1419.42s - 1422.06s] or you being the one to adjust
[1422.06s - 1424.22s] because it's your complaining about it
[1424.22s - 1426.94s] that is creating the friction and the resentment.
[1426.94s - 1429.66s] And this is not only with romantic relationships
[1429.66s - 1432.06s] like when I think about the broader applications
[1432.06s - 1433.02s] of this for family.
[1434.30s - 1437.10s] There are very challenging people
[1437.10s - 1438.22s] in my extended family,
[1438.22s - 1439.98s] just like everybody's family, right?
[1439.98s - 1442.30s] And so there's always one person in your life
[1442.30s - 1444.38s] that you wish there just wasn't drama with.
[1444.38s - 1446.06s] You wish they didn't have a challenging
[1446.06s - 1447.34s] demeanor or personality.
[1447.90s - 1450.94s] The let them theory has fundamentally,
[1450.94s - 1453.34s] profoundly changed my relationship also
[1453.98s - 1456.70s] with people that have been difficult.
[1457.34s - 1459.66s] Because when I say let them,
[1459.66s - 1460.62s] like let's say you're talking,
[1461.42s - 1463.26s] we're talking about somebody who's very narcissistic
[1463.26s - 1465.02s] or dramatic or victim or they're all,
[1465.02s - 1465.90s] it's always about them
[1465.90s - 1467.50s] and very draining person to be around.
[1468.06s - 1470.14s] Well, part of the reason why they're draining
[1470.14s - 1473.98s] is because you brace and you get ready for it.
[1474.06s - 1477.74s] And you allow their energy to impact you.
[1477.74s - 1479.18s] And I always find it funny, Jay,
[1479.82s - 1482.14s] that especially in families and at work,
[1482.94s - 1485.34s] we allow the most challenging person
[1485.98s - 1487.98s] to have the biggest impact on the whole system.
[1488.77s - 1491.81s] So if you have one person that's narcissistic
[1491.81s - 1493.17s] in their personality style
[1493.17s - 1496.37s] or that is very, very dramatic and immature
[1496.37s - 1497.97s] in their personality style,
[1497.97s - 1500.29s] they're the one, if you imagine a spider web, right?
[1500.29s - 1502.53s] I think about a system of relationships
[1502.53s - 1503.33s] like a spider web.
[1503.33s - 1505.41s] And you're out in the morning, the do's on it.
[1505.41s - 1506.69s] When you have a challenging person,
[1506.69s - 1508.45s] because we all tiptoe around this person,
[1509.01s - 1511.25s] that person's energy is like tap, tap, tap
[1511.25s - 1512.29s] and shakes all the dew off.
[1512.85s - 1514.21s] I believe the opposite is true,
[1514.85s - 1516.69s] especially after learning the let them theory
[1516.69s - 1519.01s] because there's been people in my life,
[1519.01s - 1521.49s] both in work life and in my family life
[1521.49s - 1523.17s] where when that person's around,
[1523.17s - 1524.93s] I literally shrink to eight years old.
[1525.57s - 1527.49s] I'm dancing around their mood.
[1528.05s - 1529.73s] We all have had an experience like this.
[1529.73s - 1531.17s] Maybe you're thinking about a boss
[1531.17s - 1533.09s] or your mother or your father-in-law
[1533.09s - 1535.65s] or a brother or whomever, an adult child, right?
[1537.57s - 1539.65s] When I walk into these situations now
[1540.66s - 1543.70s] and I say, let them, let them be who they are.
[1545.47s - 1548.35s] Why am I making it my job to manage their mood?
[1548.35s - 1549.15s] Yeah.
[1549.15s - 1552.75s] Why am I pouring time and energy into this drama?
[1554.18s - 1556.50s] Let me manage my energy.
[1556.50s - 1558.02s] Let me remind myself,
[1558.02s - 1560.50s] I can remove myself from any dinner table,
[1560.50s - 1562.10s] any family text chain.
[1562.10s - 1563.78s] I can remove myself from an interview,
[1563.78s - 1566.82s] a date, a conversation, a relationship anytime I want.
[1567.62s - 1570.58s] And I believe, Jay, that the person
[1570.58s - 1574.80s] that is the most peaceful and centered and powerful
[1575.52s - 1578.88s] because you understand the power of your energy
[1578.88s - 1580.88s] and your thoughts and your actions,
[1580.88s - 1583.68s] you actually have more power in any family system
[1583.68s - 1586.32s] and any office building in any room,
[1586.32s - 1588.88s] anywhere than the most challenging person.
[1588.88s - 1590.00s] I couldn't agree more.
[1590.00s - 1590.88s] I couldn't agree more.
[1590.88s - 1591.52s] I love that.
[1591.52s - 1595.28s] And I feel like when you start looking at your energy
[1595.28s - 1598.00s] and time, if you thought about it like money
[1598.64s - 1601.20s] and this idea that imagine for every thought
[1601.20s - 1604.32s] you had about that person, you had to pay them a dollar.
[1604.88s - 1606.48s] And you think about how many dollars,
[1606.48s - 1608.16s] if you now started to count the amount of thoughts
[1608.16s - 1609.44s] you were having about that person,
[1609.44s - 1611.44s] about that situation, about what they said,
[1611.44s - 1613.12s] about what they said to so-and-so,
[1613.12s - 1614.24s] what they thought about you,
[1614.24s - 1616.16s] and you had to pay a dollar for every thought
[1616.16s - 1618.64s] you had about them, that's how much energy time
[1618.64s - 1620.96s] and money is being wasted.
[1621.20s - 1624.00s] And we're not realizing where else it could be invested
[1624.00s - 1625.04s] and put in.
[1625.04s - 1626.96s] But I think you hit the nail on the head there.
[1627.60s - 1632.64s] The reason is we feel so attached that we don't feel
[1633.28s - 1635.04s] we can actually leave.
[1635.04s - 1636.32s] As Thich Nhat Hanh would say,
[1636.96s - 1640.96s] we would rather live in the familiar pain
[1640.96s - 1642.24s] than the unfamiliar pain.
[1642.80s - 1645.68s] At least we know what we're going to get with this person.
[1645.68s - 1647.68s] And there's a part of us that gets attached to that
[1647.68s - 1649.28s] even subconsciously.
[1649.28s - 1650.48s] Well, here's the thing though, Jay.
[1652.03s - 1654.59s] Because I think it's a really important point
[1654.59s - 1655.63s] that you're bringing up,
[1655.63s - 1657.15s] but here's what I think you're going to discover.
[1658.26s - 1660.10s] I think you're only attached to it
[1660.90s - 1665.14s] because you don't value your time and energy.
[1665.70s - 1666.66s] For sure.
[1666.66s - 1669.38s] You're only attached to it because you've never
[1669.38s - 1671.30s] experienced anything else.
[1672.10s - 1674.18s] And the reason why you're used to it
[1674.90s - 1677.70s] is because in the relationship dynamic,
[1678.66s - 1682.82s] you're up in your head, usually in a relationship
[1682.82s - 1684.42s] explaining a way behavior
[1685.30s - 1688.42s] instead of actually seeing it with clear eyes
[1689.54s - 1690.82s] and detaching from it.
[1690.82s - 1691.94s] And that's the other reason,
[1691.94s - 1693.54s] and I know you knew this instantly,
[1693.54s - 1696.02s] that the let them theory and saying,
[1696.02s - 1697.46s] let them and let me,
[1697.46s - 1699.22s] one of the reasons why it's so powerful
[1699.22s - 1701.46s] and I'm so excited is I feel literally
[1701.46s - 1703.86s] like I am surrounded by ancestors
[1704.66s - 1707.94s] because this is a modern application
[1707.94s - 1711.22s] of ancient philosophy, spiritual guidance,
[1711.22s - 1714.10s] stoicism, detachment theory
[1714.10s - 1717.70s] that you can then apply in any moment
[1717.70s - 1718.98s] in any relationship.
[1719.62s - 1722.10s] And what I also love about this, Jay,
[1722.10s - 1727.86s] is that I think it allows you to truly see people,
[1728.58s - 1730.50s] perhaps for the first time,
[1731.46s - 1734.74s] and to give them the space to be who they are.
[1735.94s - 1739.62s] And from that space, what's amazing is
[1740.26s - 1742.02s] you can let people, for example,
[1742.02s - 1745.46s] a lot of us are very triggered and motivated
[1745.46s - 1747.22s] when somebody's disappointed
[1747.22s - 1751.62s] or we think that somebody's gonna really be let down by us.
[1752.18s - 1753.78s] And I had this huge breakthrough
[1753.78s - 1755.86s] because I used to feel really guilty,
[1755.86s - 1757.38s] either by how much I work
[1757.38s - 1760.18s] or the fact that Chris and I raised our kids
[1760.18s - 1762.42s] on the East Coast and my parents are in the Midwest
[1762.42s - 1764.10s] and I love my parents
[1764.10s - 1765.22s] and I wish we all lived together,
[1765.22s - 1765.78s] but here's the thing,
[1765.78s - 1767.62s] they're not moving to me and I'm not moving to them.
[1767.62s - 1768.66s] We gotta let them, right?
[1769.46s - 1771.14s] But there's a lot of emotion about it
[1771.14s - 1772.98s] and I know your family's all over the place too,
[1772.98s - 1774.26s] so you're nodding like,
[1774.26s - 1775.30s] I'm not saying anything
[1775.30s - 1776.98s] because my family listens to that smell.
[1778.50s - 1779.54s] So here's the thing,
[1780.26s - 1783.46s] if I don't go home with my family for the holidays,
[1784.26s - 1785.46s] my parents are disappointed.
[1786.58s - 1789.07s] Let them be disappointed.
[1790.05s - 1791.41s] I mean, isn't that a beautiful thing
[1792.45s - 1793.49s] that they're disappointed?
[1795.52s - 1797.44s] Don't you want somebody to be disappointed
[1798.77s - 1799.65s] that you're not coming?
[1800.50s - 1802.66s] That really messes with people's minds.
[1802.66s - 1803.38s] Right?
[1803.38s - 1803.46s] Yeah.
[1803.46s - 1806.58s] Like whether you can't make it to a business engagement
[1807.14s - 1808.98s] or you can't make it to a birthday party
[1809.94s - 1813.30s] or you can't make it this year home,
[1813.86s - 1814.90s] I mean, what's the alternative?
[1814.90s - 1816.42s] That they're like, thank God, Jay's not coming.
[1816.42s - 1817.22s] I can't stand him.
[1818.51s - 1819.55s] No, seriously.
[1819.55s - 1821.47s] Like really wrap your brain around this
[1821.95s - 1825.15s] and so when you say let them be disappointed,
[1825.15s - 1826.19s] something beautiful happens.
[1826.19s - 1828.67s] You actually honor their experience of being human.
[1829.31s - 1830.67s] You allow them to be adults.
[1830.67s - 1830.99s] Yes.
[1831.71s - 1834.43s] That is a sign, that emotion,
[1834.43s - 1836.03s] that things are really good in your relationship.
[1836.03s - 1836.27s] Yes.
[1837.25s - 1838.37s] But then you say let me
[1839.39s - 1842.03s] and the old me would twist myself in knots
[1842.03s - 1843.63s] and then I would make myself feel bad
[1843.63s - 1845.31s] and then I would question what I was doing
[1845.31s - 1846.59s] and then I'd bend over backwards
[1846.59s - 1848.27s] and try to be there and try to be here
[1848.27s - 1849.71s] and instead when I say let me,
[1849.71s - 1850.75s] I drop into my values.
[1850.75s - 1852.11s] I deeply value family.
[1852.75s - 1855.98s] And so if they're disappointed,
[1855.98s - 1857.66s] that's not the reason I would change plans.
[1858.94s - 1860.78s] I have to look at what do I think,
[1860.78s - 1861.74s] what do I want to do
[1861.74s - 1863.66s] and how am I going to process my emotions.
[1863.66s - 1864.46s] Yes.
[1864.46s - 1866.70s] And so as someone else is disappointed,
[1866.70s - 1869.18s] the old me would feel deeply guilty and conflicted.
[1870.14s - 1871.58s] Now with the let them theory,
[1871.58s - 1875.33s] I have space for them to be disappointed
[1875.33s - 1876.77s] and for me to feel a little sad.
[1877.57s - 1880.61s] But if I change plans, I don't do it for them.
[1881.63s - 1882.99s] Because if I change plans for them,
[1882.99s - 1883.71s] guess what I just did?
[1883.71s - 1885.07s] I made them the villain in my life.
[1886.03s - 1889.15s] If I change plans because it makes me feel
[1889.15s - 1891.47s] like a good daughter, it makes me feel good.
[1891.47s - 1894.03s] Now I take responsibility for my life
[1895.07s - 1897.15s] and I am owning my decisions.
[1897.95s - 1899.87s] And it's a small nuance,
[1899.87s - 1902.75s] but it's absolutely everything.
[1903.63s - 1904.19s] Everything.
[1905.31s - 1907.31s] And the other reason why I love this,
[1907.31s - 1909.23s] especially as a parent of adult children
[1909.23s - 1913.31s] and this is a book about adult relationships.
[1913.31s - 1916.03s] And so I make it very clear in the book
[1916.03s - 1917.39s] and there's resources for parents
[1917.39s - 1918.59s] with younger kids in back.
[1918.59s - 1920.91s] But one of the coolest things about this
[1920.91s - 1924.27s] is that when you let someone have their emotions
[1924.91s - 1928.03s] and you let someone struggle while you say,
[1928.03s - 1930.11s] I'm on the sidelines and I'm here to support,
[1930.11s - 1933.79s] but I know that the greatest teacher in life is life.
[1933.79s - 1936.27s] And I'm not going to shield you from the consequences
[1936.27s - 1937.55s] of some of the things that you're choosing.
[1937.55s - 1938.59s] You're an adult.
[1938.67s - 1941.63s] So I'm going to let you, when you allow someone,
[1941.63s - 1943.31s] the space to process emotion
[1943.31s - 1945.87s] and the space to face their struggles
[1945.87s - 1948.75s] and the space to heal on their own timeline
[1948.75s - 1950.03s] and in their own way,
[1950.03s - 1952.43s] you actually communicate that I believe that you can.
[1953.87s - 1956.43s] When you step in and try to force somebody
[1956.43s - 1959.07s] to be more motivated at school or you,
[1959.07s - 1959.95s] let's just take that one.
[1959.95s - 1964.43s] Because there's a lot of people that listen to my show
[1964.43s - 1967.23s] and I'm sure it's the same people that are listening to yours
[1967.95s - 1968.91s] that write in or like,
[1968.91s - 1970.83s] I don't know how to make this person more motivated.
[1970.83s - 1971.63s] Oh, for sure.
[1971.63s - 1972.11s] Right?
[1972.11s - 1972.19s] For sure.
[1972.19s - 1973.87s] And so here's what I want you to understand.
[1973.87s - 1975.55s] And this was another huge breakthrough
[1975.55s - 1976.59s] when I was writing this book.
[1977.15s - 1979.55s] Do you want to know the hardest working person
[1979.55s - 1980.35s] in a classroom, Jay?
[1980.99s - 1982.03s] It's the kid who's struggling.
[1983.26s - 1984.94s] It's not the people that are getting straight A's.
[1985.95s - 1988.03s] It's the person who's having a really hard time.
[1988.03s - 1988.27s] Wow.
[1988.99s - 1990.59s] Do you want to know the hardest person
[1990.59s - 1991.63s] that's working on their health?
[1991.63s - 1993.55s] It's actually the person that's unhealthy
[1994.85s - 1998.53s] because they know that they want to be healthier.
[1999.09s - 2000.37s] And so they are not stuck.
[2000.37s - 2003.57s] They're in deep conflict actively within themselves.
[2004.29s - 2006.85s] And so if somebody is already aware
[2006.85s - 2008.85s] that there is a gap between their potential
[2009.57s - 2010.61s] and how they're performing,
[2011.49s - 2015.25s] that there is a gap between their God-given right
[2015.25s - 2018.13s] to thrive and be happy and be connected
[2018.13s - 2020.45s] and what their life actually feels like,
[2020.45s - 2021.17s] they know it.
[2022.13s - 2025.65s] And then you come in and try to impose your will
[2025.65s - 2026.61s] or your good ideas.
[2026.61s - 2027.73s] Oh, thanks a lot.
[2027.73s - 2032.21s] So I never thought that if I wanted to get good grades,
[2032.21s - 2034.53s] I needed to study and not play video games.
[2034.53s - 2035.49s] Thank you, Einstein.
[2036.13s - 2038.69s] Oh, I should go to the gym if I want to lose some weight.
[2038.69s - 2039.57s] Never thought of that.
[2040.13s - 2044.21s] So you come in and you have judgment and assumptions.
[2044.21s - 2047.65s] What is it that's more pressure on top of somebody
[2047.65s - 2051.33s] who is actually already deeply conflicted with themselves?
[2051.33s - 2051.65s] Yeah.
[2052.29s - 2054.93s] And so if you really embrace this
[2055.97s - 2057.81s] and you understand that people change
[2057.81s - 2059.41s] when they feel like it and when they can,
[2059.41s - 2061.17s] and if somebody's struggling,
[2062.19s - 2064.67s] it's because they're not able to right now.
[2064.67s - 2066.51s] There's a skill that's missing.
[2066.51s - 2068.83s] And one of the biggest things that's typically missing
[2068.83s - 2072.03s] is the belief that any of the small actions
[2072.03s - 2073.79s] will actually do anything anyway.
[2073.79s - 2074.03s] Yeah.
[2074.67s - 2076.51s] And so you coming in and imposing it,
[2076.51s - 2077.79s] you know what that says?
[2077.79s - 2079.87s] It actually says, I don't believe you can do this.
[2080.59s - 2081.47s] I'll do it for you.
[2081.47s - 2081.79s] Yes.
[2081.79s - 2082.59s] I can do it for you.
[2082.59s - 2083.23s] Because you can't.
[2083.23s - 2083.87s] I can solve it for you.
[2083.87s - 2085.15s] Yeah, absolutely.
[2085.15s - 2086.75s] If you can't control it,
[2087.63s - 2092.27s] why on earth would you allow any time or energy
[2092.27s - 2095.55s] to be wasted because you're going to keep this person
[2095.55s - 2098.35s] in your life even though they walked out the door,
[2098.35s - 2100.35s] which is why you have to let them?
[2100.35s - 2102.35s] You're not just letting them leave.
[2103.23s - 2107.54s] You have to unlearn the patterns of your life.
[2108.34s - 2109.62s] That were with them.
[2109.62s - 2111.86s] I remember, I mean, Radhi actually got married
[2111.86s - 2112.90s] and we moved to America.
[2113.54s - 2115.06s] And Radhi will say this herself,
[2115.06s - 2116.10s] that at that time in her life,
[2116.10s - 2118.34s] her parents had made a lot of big decisions for her.
[2119.14s - 2122.18s] And she was following decisions that they were making
[2122.18s - 2124.82s] or opportunities that they were putting forward.
[2124.82s - 2127.22s] And all of that was with good intention.
[2127.22s - 2128.74s] And then when we got married,
[2128.74s - 2131.78s] she'd start to ask me for my advice or my insight.
[2131.78s - 2134.90s] This would be anything from what plates
[2134.90s - 2136.90s] we should buy for our apartment
[2136.90s - 2138.82s] through to what kind of curtains we wanted.
[2138.82s - 2141.86s] We're talking about really small everyday things.
[2141.86s - 2143.30s] And I remember, I would always say to her,
[2143.30s - 2144.18s] well, what do you think?
[2145.04s - 2147.76s] And she'd always say, no, no, no, you just tell me.
[2147.76s - 2149.36s] And I'll be like, no, but what do you think?
[2149.36s - 2151.92s] And in the start, it would really frustrate her.
[2151.92s - 2153.76s] But now she looks back and she goes,
[2153.76s - 2156.16s] that question helped her so much
[2156.16s - 2158.48s] because it helped her find her own identity,
[2158.48s - 2160.96s] her own strength, her own tastes, her own dislikes.
[2160.96s - 2163.68s] And now she's a whole human with opinions.
[2163.68s - 2165.36s] And it's so fascinating to watch that.
[2165.36s - 2169.70s] And it was because I almost had this for visioning
[2169.70s - 2174.10s] or this thought that even if I make my life easier
[2174.10s - 2177.46s] by just telling her my tastes and dislikes and likes,
[2178.02s - 2179.62s] it's only going to be easy in the short term
[2179.62s - 2181.30s] because 10 years from now,
[2181.30s - 2184.26s] she's going to think she became the person I wanted her to be
[2184.26s - 2186.02s] and never became the person she could be.
[2186.66s - 2188.10s] And I could see that.
[2188.10s - 2190.26s] And so I set up and I was like, no, you just tell me.
[2190.26s - 2191.94s] Until this day, I always practice.
[2191.94s - 2193.22s] I'm like, I think you look beautiful,
[2193.22s - 2195.94s] but I want you to wear what you want to wear.
[2195.94s - 2198.34s] It shouldn't be about what I think you look better in
[2198.34s - 2200.66s] or worse, that just shouldn't be the case.
[2200.66s - 2205.78s] And it's so interesting how we think love is over caring.
[2205.78s - 2209.78s] But actually over caring is over enabling that person
[2209.78s - 2210.98s] and overwhelming that person.
[2210.98s - 2212.42s] Yes, and it's control.
[2212.42s - 2213.30s] It's control.
[2213.30s - 2217.98s] You're not like, if you think about what love really is,
[2217.98s - 2220.22s] and for me, love is two things.
[2220.22s - 2221.82s] It's consideration, right?
[2221.82s - 2223.02s] It's having someone in mind.
[2223.66s - 2228.38s] If you pour in oat milk instead of the cow milk,
[2229.02s - 2231.98s] because that's what they like, that's an act of love.
[2232.78s - 2234.70s] It's also admiration.
[2234.70s - 2237.58s] And admiration is the ability to see something
[2237.58s - 2239.26s] in somebody that you deeply admire.
[2239.90s - 2241.90s] I want to go back to something that you said though,
[2241.90s - 2244.46s] because it was genius.
[2245.42s - 2252.30s] And it had me think about the idea of the power
[2252.30s - 2253.98s] of your time and energy.
[2253.98s - 2258.54s] And you were talking about imagine if your time
[2258.54s - 2261.26s] and your energy had dollars associated with it,
[2261.98s - 2263.34s] because I don't think we value it.
[2264.30s - 2268.54s] And I started to think about one of the biggest obstacles,
[2268.54s - 2271.10s] because what's ultimately happening when you start to use
[2271.10s - 2272.70s] let them and let me is you're going to see
[2272.70s - 2275.18s] that you've turned other people into a major problem.
[2275.18s - 2278.70s] And you have turned them into a problem in four ways.
[2278.70s - 2280.38s] First of all, you allow them to stress you out,
[2280.38s - 2281.50s] but you're not going to do that anymore,
[2281.50s - 2283.10s] because you're going to let them be.
[2284.30s - 2286.46s] But the second way that you've made them a major problem
[2286.46s - 2290.54s] in your life is that you give so much weight
[2291.42s - 2293.66s] to other people's opinions.
[2294.38s - 2297.26s] And in the example you were just talking about,
[2297.26s - 2300.78s] what was happening is by asking you what do you think?
[2301.94s - 2303.62s] Roddy was doing what we all do,
[2304.26s - 2306.02s] but most of us do it subconsciously
[2306.02s - 2307.30s] and we don't even realize it,
[2307.86s - 2311.06s] which is before we even ask ourselves
[2311.06s - 2312.34s] what feels right for us,
[2312.90s - 2316.34s] we stop and consider what we think somebody's going to think.
[2316.34s - 2318.34s] And you have that really brilliant thing
[2318.34s - 2320.50s] that I've heard you say a bazillion times that I love.
[2320.50s - 2321.78s] It's not what you think you think you think,
[2321.78s - 2322.98s] and I'm like, wait, what?
[2322.98s - 2324.74s] But so I want to play this out,
[2324.74s - 2328.02s] because this is so important was a huge thing for me.
[2328.82s - 2330.98s] If you open up your favorite social media platform,
[2331.76s - 2335.04s] we've all had the experience where you go and you pick a photo
[2335.94s - 2339.42s] and you then put it up and you're like,
[2339.50s - 2341.18s] okay, should I put filter on this?
[2341.18s - 2343.26s] And you start to then question, is this the right photo?
[2343.26s - 2344.54s] And then you go back to your photo roll
[2344.54s - 2345.90s] and then you start working on the caption.
[2345.90s - 2347.50s] Should I put emoji? Is this too much?
[2347.50s - 2348.22s] Should I do this?
[2348.78s - 2351.90s] And then you are worried why?
[2353.17s - 2355.97s] Because you're actually thinking about what other people
[2356.69s - 2359.81s] are going to think or do in response to what you're posting.
[2359.81s - 2360.37s] Yes.
[2360.37s - 2364.85s] Which means if you take the value of it, right,
[2364.85s - 2367.97s] you just overvalued something
[2367.97s - 2369.57s] that you will never be able to control.
[2369.97s - 2372.06s] Ever. Ever, ever, ever.
[2372.06s - 2373.66s] And yet you're doing it subconsciously.
[2373.66s - 2375.98s] And what typically happens is if you notice,
[2375.98s - 2378.54s] everybody's got hundreds of draft posts.
[2379.50s - 2379.90s] Yeah.
[2379.90s - 2380.70s] You know what that is?
[2380.70s - 2381.18s] Yeah.
[2381.18s - 2383.50s] That is a graveyard of energy you wasted.
[2383.50s - 2384.06s] Oh, so good.
[2384.06s - 2385.90s] On something that you didn't,
[2385.90s - 2387.02s] you'll never be able to control,
[2387.02s - 2390.78s] because the average person has 70,000 random thoughts a day.
[2391.34s - 2393.98s] You can't even control half the crap that goes in your own mind.
[2393.98s - 2396.14s] So what makes you think any post
[2396.86s - 2399.90s] is going to guarantee that any human being thinks anything.
[2400.83s - 2403.55s] And the let them theory revealed to me, Jay,
[2403.55s - 2410.11s] how often I was subconsciously valuing someone else
[2410.75s - 2412.59s] and that like, are they going to think negative?
[2412.59s - 2413.15s] Are they going to think this?
[2413.15s - 2414.19s] Are they going to think too much?
[2414.19s - 2416.83s] And there's such a simple way to change this.
[2416.83s - 2418.35s] You just let them think negative thoughts.
[2418.91s - 2419.31s] That's it.
[2420.45s - 2423.89s] The next time you catch yourself stopping to consider
[2423.89s - 2428.61s] what you're going to post or what your colleagues might react to,
[2428.61s - 2430.21s] and that's what's keeping you silent,
[2430.21s - 2431.81s] say to yourself, let them think negative thoughts,
[2432.64s - 2434.72s] because that's what you're actually afraid of.
[2434.72s - 2435.12s] Yeah.
[2435.12s - 2438.16s] And so when you say, let them think negative thoughts,
[2438.16s - 2441.76s] something wild happens, you accept the reality
[2442.40s - 2443.76s] that no matter what you do,
[2443.76s - 2446.16s] it doesn't guarantee that anybody thinks anything.
[2446.16s - 2446.80s] Yeah.
[2446.80s - 2449.92s] And then you say, let me, and here's where this gets really cool.
[2451.20s - 2453.04s] Let me remind myself, I can think what I want,
[2453.04s - 2454.48s] and I can do what I want.
[2454.48s - 2457.20s] And your social media in particular, as you and I both know,
[2457.20s - 2458.56s] it's your self-expression.
[2459.95s - 2460.99s] That's what it's there for.
[2462.11s - 2466.51s] And if you can't allow yourself to express yourself there,
[2467.76s - 2470.72s] then it's going to be everywhere where you edit yourself
[2470.72s - 2474.16s] because you're not just letting people think negative thoughts.
[2474.16s - 2474.72s] For sure.
[2474.72s - 2478.24s] But if you operate in a way now and you now take the value,
[2478.24s - 2479.04s] you take the money back,
[2479.04s - 2483.20s] we're not going to pay Jay the money for his opinion.
[2483.20s - 2485.92s] I'm going to take the money back and where I'm going to put the value
[2485.92s - 2488.56s] is operating in a way that makes me feel proud of myself.
[2489.20s - 2491.28s] Because when I operate in a way,
[2491.28s - 2493.76s] whether I'm posting something or I'm speaking in a meeting
[2493.76s - 2496.88s] or I'm showing up and not responding to my dramatic whatever,
[2497.92s - 2499.52s] I'm proud of myself.
[2499.52s - 2500.88s] And when you're proud of yourself,
[2501.44s - 2503.68s] you don't even consider what other people are thinking
[2504.40s - 2510.32s] because you've just anchored all of your worth inside of yourself.
[2511.28s - 2515.76s] And that's why this is another reason why this is so unbelievably powerful.
[2515.76s - 2516.16s] Yeah.
[2516.16s - 2520.32s] And the truth is no one's thinking about you for as long as you think.
[2520.32s - 2520.72s] It's true.
[2520.72s - 2523.28s] No one's thinking about you for as much as you think.
[2523.28s - 2526.80s] No one's thinking about you as much as they even say they're thinking about you.
[2526.80s - 2531.20s] And we just, like you said, we keep draining that energy consumed by it.
[2531.20s - 2537.84s] You reminded me of the beautiful Charles Horton Cooley quote and he wrote this in 1890.
[2537.84s - 2541.20s] And he said, the challenge today is I'm not what I think I am.
[2541.20s - 2543.36s] I'm not what you think I am.
[2543.36s - 2546.24s] I am what I think you think I am.
[2546.24s - 2549.60s] Which means we live in a perception of a perception of ourselves.
[2549.60s - 2556.48s] So if I think Mel thinks I'm not smart, then I don't think I'm smart.
[2556.48s - 2558.16s] So it's not even reality.
[2558.16s - 2561.20s] It's not even factually proven or checked or tested.
[2561.76s - 2564.64s] By the way, everything in the Let Them Theory, this book,
[2564.64s - 2567.52s] is literally every thought, those 70,000 thoughts.
[2567.52s - 2569.28s] That's what you're addressing in this book.
[2569.28s - 2571.28s] And let them, two words, gets rid of this fear.
[2571.28s - 2571.68s] Yeah.
[2571.68s - 2572.56s] It literally does.
[2572.56s - 2575.68s] Because I was talking, I've talked to at least three friends this week
[2575.68s - 2579.76s] and all of them are concerned by either, hey, Jay,
[2579.76s - 2581.76s] I'm thinking about posting a video on social media.
[2581.76s - 2583.60s] I'm scared of what people will think.
[2583.60s - 2586.32s] So that's for their professional or their passion.
[2586.32s - 2590.32s] I've got another friend who's worried that a lot of our other friends are talking
[2590.32s - 2594.16s] about him negatively because he's recently fallen out with them.
[2594.56s - 2595.36s] And so he's worried.
[2595.36s - 2596.08s] Like, what are they saying?
[2596.08s - 2597.12s] They're all talking to each other.
[2597.12s - 2598.80s] What rumors are they spreading about me?
[2598.80s - 2600.16s] Like, maybe it's not true.
[2601.12s - 2606.16s] And the thing that they're holding on to is they just can't let them.
[2607.20s - 2607.92s] No, but they can.
[2607.92s - 2608.48s] Yeah.
[2608.48s - 2609.84s] See, I don't think they have the tool.
[2609.84s - 2610.32s] Yeah.
[2610.32s - 2611.36s] See, here's the thing.
[2611.36s - 2614.00s] If you're worried that people are gossiping about you, let them.
[2614.56s - 2615.84s] Let them gossip about you.
[2615.84s - 2616.40s] Here's why.
[2617.04s - 2618.48s] You can't control it.
[2618.48s - 2619.76s] It's going to happen anyway.
[2619.76s - 2620.08s] Yes.
[2620.80s - 2629.52s] And so if you can't control it, why on earth would you allow any time or energy to be wasted?
[2630.40s - 2630.88s] Yeah.
[2630.88s - 2632.40s] It's an act of self-torture.
[2633.31s - 2637.79s] So if you are worried that people are gossiping about you, first of all, let them gossip about
[2637.79s - 2642.43s] you because they're going to do what they're going to do because you cannot change what
[2642.43s - 2643.39s] other people do.
[2643.39s - 2644.59s] You can't control what they think.
[2644.59s - 2645.79s] You can't control what they do.
[2645.79s - 2647.63s] If they're going to gossip, they're going to gossip.
[2647.63s - 2648.75s] So let them gossip.
[2649.31s - 2653.39s] And when you say that, it's a relief because you actually acknowledge the thing that you've
[2653.39s - 2656.19s] been afraid of and it's like you're allowing it without allowing it.
[2656.19s - 2657.95s] But then don't forget, you have power.
[2659.07s - 2664.32s] Let me remind myself that I get to choose what I think about myself.
[2665.04s - 2671.04s] I get to decide what I do and what I don't do, whether or not I respond or not.
[2671.76s - 2675.60s] And I get to decide who I spend time with.
[2675.68s - 2681.36s] And so the bigger question becomes, if you're busy worrying about, which means you're
[2681.36s - 2688.66s] spending time and energy, people who are gossiping about you, why would you want to
[2688.66s - 2689.46s] be friends with them?
[2689.46s - 2690.10s] Yeah.
[2690.10s - 2697.95s] And so now you take responsibility for your own part in chasing people that aren't
[2697.95s - 2700.11s] treating you in a way that you deserve.
[2700.11s - 2700.75s] Yes.
[2700.75s - 2704.67s] And you recognize that the power here isn't just letting people be.
[2704.67s - 2710.11s] And when you let people be, your relationships get better because people reveal who they are
[2710.11s - 2710.91s] and where you stand.
[2710.91s - 2714.11s] And then you get to choose how much time you spend or not.
[2714.83s - 2718.27s] And not everybody in your life deserves an explanation.
[2719.82s - 2722.62s] They don't deserve a response necessarily.
[2723.38s - 2729.38s] And so you also get to choose who you tell your story to or who you apologize to or who,
[2729.94s - 2730.98s] how you respond to it.
[2730.98s - 2732.74s] And that's where your power is.
[2732.98s - 2738.48s] And I'm not saying this makes it easy because you're probably in a situation like that,
[2738.48s - 2741.20s] going to have to say, let them, let them, let them.
[2741.20s - 2743.36s] And then you're going to see them on social media and you're going to be like,
[2743.36s - 2743.92s] should I block them?
[2743.92s - 2744.64s] Should I not block them?
[2744.64s - 2745.52s] Are they going to see if I do that?
[2745.52s - 2746.96s] Should I not going to let them?
[2747.60s - 2748.64s] Let them know their lives.
[2748.64s - 2754.48s] And if I want to unfollow them, let me do that because I get to choose what comes into my
[2754.48s - 2755.28s] space or not.
[2755.92s - 2759.92s] And when you start to really play around with this, because one of the big pushbacks that I've
[2759.92s - 2762.80s] gotten in the research is, what am I just going to be a dormant?
[2762.80s - 2763.84s] I'm going to let people abuse me.
[2763.84s - 2764.88s] I'm going to let people...
[2764.88s - 2769.04s] No, actually it's the opposite because you're probably allowing it right now
[2769.04s - 2770.16s] and then explaining it away.
[2771.12s - 2776.19s] When you say, let them, you're letting somebody's behavior speak.
[2777.15s - 2779.63s] And then you have to bring it back to yourself and say,
[2780.43s - 2782.51s] I've got to let them reveal who they are.
[2783.50s - 2787.10s] And if this person keeps gaslighting me or not including me,
[2788.26s - 2793.22s] now I've got to ask myself, is this actually the relationship for me?
[2793.22s - 2797.06s] Mel, do you think we expect too much from people?
[2797.06s - 2797.86s] I do.
[2797.86s - 2801.86s] I think everybody's really busy and life is very overwhelming.
[2802.69s - 2807.09s] And you have no idea what's going on in other people's lives.
[2807.73s - 2813.17s] And we've gotten to a point in today's world where if I text you, I expect Jay to respond.
[2813.73s - 2818.37s] And if Jay doesn't respond, then I make it mean something about Jay or me.
[2819.58s - 2824.56s] And I hate that because it doesn't give people grace.
[2825.36s - 2832.40s] We're constantly expecting people to show up a certain way and then judging them when they don't
[2833.04s - 2836.24s] instead of stopping to consider that other people have lives
[2836.88s - 2839.28s] and other people have a lot of things going on.
[2839.36s - 2843.84s] And sometimes when people go silent on you, it has nothing to do with you.
[2844.48s - 2846.88s] It has to do with a crazy busy period in life.
[2847.44s - 2849.92s] Or it has to do with the fact that something's going on with their family.
[2850.56s - 2854.56s] And they're so drained at the end of the day that the last thing they want to do is talk to anybody.
[2855.49s - 2862.69s] And so I do think we expect too much because relationships feel very like transactional.
[2862.69s - 2864.37s] You do this for me, I do this for you.
[2864.37s - 2866.61s] I text you, you better text me back.
[2866.61s - 2874.45s] Now, there are rules in terms of just being courteous to people and being gracious to people.
[2875.17s - 2880.85s] But I'm deeply concerned, Jay, about the rise of both estrangement.
[2881.41s - 2886.61s] I'm concerned about the amount of posts that go viral about, you know, I got my life better
[2886.61s - 2889.17s] because I cut all the talks of people out.
[2889.17s - 2894.53s] And I stop and think always, well, did you have a conversation about what was bothering you?
[2895.47s - 2900.99s] Because if you just ghost other people or you use the silent treatment,
[2900.99s - 2902.59s] that's actually punishing somebody.
[2902.59s - 2905.79s] And that's extremely immature, actually.
[2905.79s - 2910.35s] It means you can't handle your own emotions, which is why you don't have a hard conversation
[2910.35s - 2913.31s] about what you need or how someone's behavior is impacting you.
[2913.87s - 2918.51s] And if you haven't had that, it's a very immature move to just cut somebody off.
[2919.15s - 2923.87s] And so I get very worried about the labeling of people as toxic.
[2924.59s - 2929.95s] And about the ease at which people seem to just drop people.
[2930.75s - 2936.27s] And what I really love about the let them theory is that it opens up the window
[2936.91s - 2938.35s] to a lot more compassion.
[2939.07s - 2942.83s] Because we're quick to think that if somebody hasn't texted you back,
[2943.39s - 2948.03s] or you've texted somebody a couple of times and they haven't responded that you did something bad.
[2948.88s - 2951.20s] And it's perfectly fine to be like, did I do something?
[2951.28s - 2954.56s] You know, I noticed you haven't responded is everything okay.
[2955.62s - 2960.10s] If they don't respond then, then something's probably wrong, either with them or with you,
[2960.10s - 2962.02s] and you get to decide what you're going to do next.
[2962.82s - 2969.06s] But I am worried about the combination of people being isolated,
[2969.06s - 2973.30s] of people spending way too much time on their phones instead of with each other,
[2973.86s - 2976.90s] and that we've gotten very transactional with one another.
[2977.46s - 2980.50s] And it's easy to forget that people have a lot going on.
[2981.06s - 2983.70s] And they're not thinking about you as much as you're thinking about them.
[2983.70s - 2985.46s] And just because you have time to text them,
[2985.46s - 2987.30s] doesn't mean they have time right now to text you back.
[2987.94s - 2990.74s] And I guarantee you when they saw your text, they probably thought,
[2990.74s - 2993.54s] oh my God, I love, you know, I got, and then something came up.
[2993.54s - 2994.26s] Yeah.
[2994.26s - 2996.18s] And so I do worry about it, Jay.
[2996.18s - 3001.78s] I do think we have too much of an expectation of something in return.
[3002.58s - 3006.34s] And when you start to use this theory, what you're also going to notice is this.
[3007.39s - 3011.39s] When you start to say, let them, you will notice that maybe you're the sibling that
[3011.39s - 3012.11s] reaches out more.
[3012.99s - 3014.11s] And it might bother you.
[3015.10s - 3020.77s] Because when you say, let them, and you keep reaching out and they don't reach out,
[3021.73s - 3025.25s] or you have a group of friends, and you notice that when you stop reaching out
[3025.25s - 3028.77s] or making the plans that you're not included in theirs, and that hurts.
[3029.81s - 3033.25s] The thing I used to do when that happened is I would make it about me.
[3034.30s - 3036.62s] I would make it like some deficiency in me.
[3037.34s - 3041.58s] And what I've learned using the let them theory, and really just saying let them,
[3041.58s - 3045.81s] which detaches from the hurt, it detaches from the judgment.
[3045.81s - 3048.21s] It reminds you that adults are allowed to live their lives.
[3048.77s - 3050.77s] Adults are allowed to come and go in friendship.
[3051.41s - 3053.81s] They're allowed to prioritize certain people at certain times,
[3053.81s - 3055.41s] they're allowed to have busy periods at work.
[3056.05s - 3058.29s] They're allowed to fall in and out of communication.
[3059.23s - 3061.95s] And the more you let people live their lives, the better your life gets,
[3061.95s - 3064.03s] and the more compassionate of a human being you become.
[3065.17s - 3071.68s] And the more I've started to recognize, oh wait, my social life is my responsibility.
[3072.48s - 3077.36s] If I have a group of friends where if I make the plans, everybody's included,
[3077.36s - 3082.56s] but if I sit back, I'm never invited, then now I got to examine,
[3082.56s - 3084.80s] am I investing in the right group of friends?
[3085.52s - 3090.56s] Or you might also wake up and realize, well, maybe I just really introverted people,
[3091.28s - 3094.08s] but I'm the party planner, and that's my role in life.
[3094.88s - 3096.96s] And instead of you being transactional,
[3096.96s - 3099.36s] you actually recognize the gift that it is to people.
[3099.36s - 3100.24s] Oh yeah.
[3100.24s - 3100.72s] Right?
[3100.72s - 3101.20s] Yeah.
[3101.20s - 3104.72s] And it sucks that maybe your siblings get together
[3104.72s - 3106.88s] because they live closer and they don't include you.
[3107.52s - 3108.64s] And it does hurt.
[3108.64s - 3113.84s] And feeling a little bit of pain like that means your mind and body is working properly.
[3113.84s - 3114.24s] Yes.
[3114.24s - 3114.48s] Right?
[3114.48s - 3115.84s] It's a sign that you're mentally well.
[3116.48s - 3118.88s] It doesn't mean there's a sign that there's anything wrong with you.
[3119.44s - 3122.48s] And so when you can say let them, and then you say let me,
[3122.48s - 3126.16s] let me decide what I want to do about this, you can have the conversation.
[3127.04s - 3134.88s] And you might realize that they just click and you don't have as close as a relationship,
[3135.68s - 3138.72s] but then you get to decide how you value family.
[3139.76s - 3143.28s] And if you're going to bring different energy, or if you're going to try a little bit harder,
[3143.28s - 3146.40s] because again, you get to choose.
[3146.40s - 3151.20s] And when you realize how much power you have, you see that through the way you think about it,
[3151.28s - 3155.92s] or you respond to it, you actually can shift anything for the better.
[3155.92s - 3156.88s] For sure.
[3156.88s - 3158.40s] And I'm really excited about this.
[3158.40s - 3161.92s] I wrote this actually with my daughter who's 25.
[3161.92s - 3170.67s] And it was an amazing experience because she was bringing a much different perspective.
[3170.67s - 3174.11s] And when we wrote the section about how you use the let them theory with love,
[3175.38s - 3182.10s] she started researching the breakup section because the fact about love is people choose
[3182.10s - 3183.38s] who and how they love.
[3183.38s - 3184.66s] And sometimes they won't choose you.
[3185.60s - 3190.32s] But you also get to choose who and how you love and how you're going to create it.
[3190.32s - 3191.36s] And people forget that.
[3192.08s - 3195.84s] And so we get to the part about when a relationship is ending.
[3196.91s - 3200.19s] And her boyfriend of two years breaks up with her.
[3200.19s - 3200.51s] And she's like-
[3200.51s - 3201.23s] While you're writing the book.
[3201.23s - 3203.23s] Yes.
[3203.23s - 3206.43s] You're like, this is horseshoe, I guess rip this up.
[3206.43s - 3208.11s] I have to let her walk out the door.
[3208.11s - 3209.07s] I have to let her believe it.
[3209.07s - 3210.27s] This is a bullshit of mine.
[3210.51s - 3219.81s] And it was this unbelievable experience because when somebody that you love
[3220.69s - 3224.05s] is grieving or going through heartbreak or struggling,
[3225.28s - 3229.47s] you would jump in front of a car to take their pain away.
[3229.47s - 3235.79s] And the let them theory and the experience of this book taught me that the best thing I could do
[3236.43s - 3244.64s] was to let her grieve, to let her be heartbroken, to let her go through her process.
[3245.44s - 3248.88s] You know, I think about it this way, like arm around somebody.
[3248.88s - 3250.08s] You're not blocking and tackling.
[3250.08s - 3252.08s] You've got your arm around somebody.
[3252.80s - 3256.72s] But if she's on the floor sobbing, let her because she needs to.
[3257.60s - 3261.12s] You know, if we need to remove the photos from the family thing,
[3261.12s - 3262.88s] because this is a two year long relationship,
[3262.88s - 3266.72s] because that is actually a huge recommendation that I make in this book
[3266.72s - 3272.48s] that you've got to follow a 30 day rule of zero contact, zero photos, zero videos.
[3272.48s - 3275.68s] Because you're not just letting them leave.
[3276.56s - 3282.91s] You have to unlearn the patterns of your life that were with them.
[3283.95s - 3286.11s] It's a withdrawal like anything else.
[3286.11s - 3286.99s] Yes.
[3286.99s - 3292.67s] And any sign of that person actually triggers the old patterns in your nervous system
[3292.67s - 3295.15s] and it delays your ability to move through it.
[3295.15s - 3296.11s] Absolutely.
[3296.11s - 3301.23s] And it's impossible when you're in it to just let them move on.
[3302.05s - 3305.65s] Because every part of your wiring and programming,
[3305.65s - 3307.33s] you're going to want to check their location.
[3307.33s - 3308.93s] You're going to want to listen to the voice memos.
[3308.93s - 3314.13s] You're going to want to saturate yourself because the life that you wanted is over.
[3315.34s - 3319.90s] And you're either going to trap yourself in a life that you're no longer in
[3320.46s - 3323.02s] by watching their life play out from afar.
[3323.58s - 3327.10s] And you're going to keep re-triggering these patterns in your nervous system
[3328.32s - 3332.64s] because you're going to keep this person in your life even though they walked out the door,
[3333.20s - 3334.80s] which is why you have to let them.
[3335.52s - 3338.32s] And then you've got to let me do the hard part,
[3338.32s - 3341.36s] which is I get to choose how I'm going to move through this.
[3342.00s - 3345.60s] And the research is also really empowering.
[3345.60s - 3348.48s] It gets better for the majority of people.
[3348.48s - 3352.16s] 71% of the people start to feel better by 11 weeks.
[3352.16s - 3353.76s] That's number 11 weeks.
[3353.76s - 3354.56s] 11 weeks.
[3354.56s - 3356.40s] And you may feel better in 11 days.
[3356.40s - 3357.68s] What happens at 11 weeks?
[3358.24s - 3361.04s] What happens at 11 weeks if you're not cyber stalking somebody
[3361.84s - 3367.70s] is that you've actually allowed your body to break the old patterns.
[3368.34s - 3371.86s] See, the reason why when you're going through a heartbreak
[3371.86s - 3374.26s] and heartbreak and breakups are just like death,
[3375.15s - 3379.07s] that's what they are because you're grieving what's no longer there.
[3379.07s - 3381.07s] The life you had, life you could have had.
[3381.07s - 3381.87s] Yes.
[3381.87s - 3385.94s] And aside from the 30 day rule, which is remove,
[3385.94s - 3388.98s] like do not look at voice memos, locations, social, nothing,
[3388.98s - 3392.34s] no photos because it triggers everything to stay alive in you.
[3393.06s - 3396.34s] But during those 30 days, what's going to happen is every time you wake up,
[3396.34s - 3399.46s] you're going to feel them there because your body remembers.
[3399.46s - 3402.50s] That doesn't mean that's a sign you should get back together.
[3403.22s - 3405.78s] That's actually a sign that you're unlearning something.
[3405.78s - 3407.81s] Let those memories come up.
[3408.83s - 3410.91s] Let your nervous system process this.
[3410.91s - 3412.19s] Every time you have news in your life,
[3412.19s - 3413.23s] you're going to want to reach out to them.
[3413.23s - 3413.47s] Why?
[3413.47s - 3415.23s] Because that was the pattern.
[3415.23s - 3416.19s] That doesn't mean you should.
[3417.31s - 3419.47s] So you've got to do the let them leave
[3419.47s - 3421.87s] and let me remind myself I'm going through this process.
[3422.67s - 3424.91s] And every day that you do that,
[3424.91s - 3427.07s] you're actually unlearning these patterns.
[3427.07s - 3429.39s] And by the time you get to about 30 days,
[3429.95s - 3432.51s] you feel less intoxicated.
[3433.31s - 3436.75s] Another huge recommendation is do something in your bedroom,
[3436.75s - 3438.67s] like paint a wall, move the bed,
[3438.67s - 3440.99s] do something because you spent a lot of time there.
[3440.99s - 3444.11s] So walking back into it is like a graveyard of your old life.
[3444.67s - 3446.11s] And it can be very triggering.
[3446.11s - 3447.31s] And so she did that.
[3448.11s - 3450.51s] And the 11 week mark is important
[3450.51s - 3455.71s] because what's happening is you're now starting to create new patterns.
[3456.43s - 3458.19s] As you've let them leave,
[3458.19s - 3459.95s] you're now letting me move on.
[3460.51s - 3465.47s] You're letting me take the actions that show me
[3465.47s - 3467.31s] that my life is moving forward.
[3467.31s - 3469.55s] And my therapist Ann Davin,
[3469.55s - 3472.11s] who's the smartest human being I've ever met,
[3472.67s - 3476.51s] she said, you know, Mel, the thing for Sawyer to ask herself is,
[3476.51s - 3478.51s] if she knew that the love of her life
[3479.39s - 3483.22s] were literally just a couple months away,
[3483.22s - 3485.78s] what would you do right now
[3486.02s - 3488.66s] with this period of time?
[3490.03s - 3491.87s] And when you think about it that way,
[3492.88s - 3495.28s] because again, as long as you're holding on
[3495.28s - 3496.88s] to somebody who already left,
[3496.88s - 3500.40s] you actually are not open to meeting anybody else.
[3501.12s - 3502.64s] That is beautiful.
[3502.64s - 3505.20s] That idea of what would you look like?
[3505.20s - 3506.80s] What would you be thinking?
[3506.80s - 3510.56s] How would you behave if the love of your life was two months away?
[3510.56s - 3513.52s] Yeah, or two years or a year away or whatever.
[3513.52s - 3515.12s] You see, because we think,
[3515.12s - 3517.36s] because when somebody leaves that you love,
[3518.16s - 3519.28s] you think you're unlovable.
[3520.00s - 3522.32s] You actually think you're never going to find it again.
[3522.88s - 3524.24s] You hate yourself.
[3524.24s - 3529.04s] That's why most of the advice about this is complete bullshit.
[3530.37s - 3531.33s] Go love yourself.
[3531.33s - 3533.01s] How the hell am I going to go love myself
[3533.01s - 3535.97s] when the person I love more than anything just left me?
[3536.61s - 3537.73s] I hate myself.
[3537.73s - 3539.01s] I despise myself.
[3539.01s - 3541.73s] I am terrified of the day that they're going to meet somebody.
[3542.29s - 3543.81s] I'm never going to find that again.
[3543.81s - 3545.17s] I'm never going to have sex like that again.
[3546.29s - 3548.21s] You hate yourself.
[3550.19s - 3552.59s] Telling somebody to just go on a revenge diet
[3552.59s - 3555.55s] or love yourself, it's horrible.
[3555.55s - 3558.59s] Instead, I want you to face reality.
[3558.59s - 3559.39s] They left.
[3559.39s - 3559.79s] Let them.
[3560.80s - 3562.40s] Then let me grieve.
[3563.44s - 3565.92s] Follow my therapist Ann Davin's advice.
[3565.92s - 3567.76s] You have to do a 30-day detox.
[3567.76s - 3570.48s] If you are somebody that's been holding on to somebody
[3570.48s - 3573.44s] that left a year ago, I guarantee you,
[3573.44s - 3576.16s] you have not gone 30 days without listening to a voice memo
[3576.16s - 3577.60s] or looking at a photo.
[3577.60s - 3579.20s] You are keeping them alive,
[3580.08s - 3582.72s] which is keeping you trapped in something that's dead.
[3584.16s - 3587.84s] And your inability to let them go and let them leave
[3588.83s - 3594.27s] and then let me accept reality and start moving forward
[3594.27s - 3599.15s] and let me believe that the person that I am meant to meet,
[3599.79s - 3600.99s] they are in the future.
[3600.99s - 3602.27s] They're not in my past.
[3602.27s - 3606.11s] And by the way, even if you kind of hold out secretly hope,
[3606.11s - 3608.35s] it might be the person from the past.
[3608.91s - 3612.19s] It might be, but they're not the version from back there.
[3612.19s - 3612.91s] And neither are you.
[3612.91s - 3613.79s] And neither are you.
[3614.35s - 3617.79s] And so you have to, again, come back to where the power is.
[3617.79s - 3619.07s] It's not in getting them back.
[3619.79s - 3621.15s] It's not in making them jealous,
[3621.15s - 3624.91s] because if you focus on making that person jealous or whatever,
[3624.91s - 3626.03s] where are you putting your power?
[3627.12s - 3627.60s] Then.
[3627.60s - 3628.96s] And something you can't control.
[3629.92s - 3632.08s] You have to put your power here.
[3632.08s - 3635.52s] And the reason why I love the 30 day rule and the 11 week mark
[3635.52s - 3637.28s] is because it's the truth.
[3637.28s - 3638.24s] This is going to suck.
[3639.55s - 3643.07s] The only way to get over someone and to go through heartbreak
[3643.07s - 3643.87s] is to go through it.
[3643.87s - 3644.83s] There's no avoiding it.
[3645.39s - 3646.59s] There's only delaying it.
[3646.59s - 3647.39s] And we delay it.
[3648.27s - 3651.47s] Because we don't want to accept people as they are.
[3652.43s - 3655.15s] When somebody breaks up and leaves or cheats on you,
[3655.15s - 3657.15s] they have just revealed who they are.
[3657.15s - 3658.11s] For sure.
[3658.11s - 3660.83s] And your inability to accept it,
[3661.71s - 3665.79s] instead of explaining it away and living in a fantasy up here,
[3665.79s - 3668.67s] that's what's keeping you from having and creating the love
[3668.67s - 3670.91s] you actually deserve and want in your life.
[3670.91s - 3672.27s] I was talking to a friend recently,
[3672.27s - 3674.19s] and everything you're saying is just so true,
[3674.19s - 3676.59s] and it's resonating so strongly to me.
[3676.59s - 3677.87s] I was talking to a friend recently,
[3678.51s - 3679.87s] and she was saying to me,
[3680.99s - 3685.31s] I wish my friend would just be honest with me.
[3685.31s - 3688.03s] I wish this person who's just screwed me over,
[3688.03s - 3689.31s] just let me down,
[3689.31s - 3692.75s] would just be honest with me rather than pretending to be my friend.
[3693.79s - 3696.43s] And I said to them, they are being honest with you.
[3697.07s - 3699.55s] Them lying is showing you their truth.
[3700.27s - 3702.11s] That's how much they value you.
[3702.11s - 3705.31s] Them pretending to be your friend is their truth.
[3705.31s - 3706.43s] You don't want the truth.
[3706.43s - 3707.87s] Actually, you want them to lie to you,
[3708.43s - 3709.95s] and you want them to be someone else.
[3709.95s - 3712.35s] You want them to become the honest person.
[3712.35s - 3715.07s] But they're showing you that they're not an honest person.
[3715.07s - 3716.27s] That is the truth.
[3716.27s - 3716.67s] It's true.
[3716.67s - 3717.63s] And here's the other thing.
[3717.63s - 3719.95s] Why are you pretending to be this person's friend,
[3719.95s - 3721.15s] and not bringing it up?
[3721.15s - 3723.31s] Why is it on them to tell you the truth?
[3723.87s - 3727.31s] Let them lie to you, and then come to the let me part.
[3728.51s - 3731.78s] If aren't you pretending that you're their friend,
[3731.78s - 3732.74s] if you haven't brought this up,
[3733.46s - 3736.50s] and you're actually holding that in your head, right?
[3737.70s - 3740.02s] There are so many applications of this.
[3740.02s - 3740.74s] So many.
[3740.74s - 3743.22s] It's just incredible.
[3743.22s - 3747.86s] And the thing that I'm really, really excited about
[3748.86s - 3753.18s] is that the other massive thing that I think
[3753.18s - 3754.54s] this is going to help people with
[3754.54s - 3757.42s] is that one other way that you make people a massive problem
[3758.22s - 3763.18s] is that you see somebody else's success or happiness
[3763.82s - 3765.90s] or the things that they achieve in their life
[3765.90s - 3768.38s] as somehow robbing you of yours.
[3769.26s - 3771.50s] And the thing about life
[3771.50s - 3773.34s] is that you're never playing against people.
[3773.34s - 3774.14s] You play with them.
[3775.20s - 3778.48s] And somebody else's success, happiness, love,
[3778.48s - 3781.52s] like the things that they achieve, it's in limitless supply.
[3782.32s - 3784.16s] And when you wrap your brain around the fact
[3784.16s - 3787.20s] that happiness, love, money, like all of it, limitless supply.
[3787.76s - 3789.36s] So other people can't block your way.
[3789.36s - 3790.56s] They actually lead the way.
[3791.12s - 3793.20s] And so if you let them lead the way,
[3793.20s - 3796.24s] and you see their wins not as your losses,
[3796.24s - 3798.56s] but you see it as an example to follow,
[3799.44s - 3802.72s] you now stop making other people a problem
[3802.72s - 3805.92s] and you stop using them as an excuse
[3805.92s - 3808.32s] for why you can't do what you're capable of.
[3809.23s - 3811.07s] Other people don't block you.
[3811.07s - 3812.03s] You block your way.
[3812.75s - 3814.99s] Allow people to lead the way.
[3814.99s - 3816.19s] And the way that you do that is you say,
[3816.19s - 3817.15s] let them be successful.
[3817.95s - 3818.83s] Let them get married.
[3818.83s - 3819.87s] Let them have the baby.
[3819.87s - 3822.75s] Let them have the nice car because they're showing me
[3822.75s - 3823.79s] what's possible.
[3823.79s - 3826.75s] And the cool thing about really embracing
[3827.31s - 3830.83s] let them in that regard is that other people
[3830.83s - 3833.15s] also show you the formula, right?
[3833.15s - 3833.95s] Yeah, absolutely.
[3833.95s - 3835.63s] They show you exactly how to do something.
[3835.63s - 3836.19s] 100%.
[3836.19s - 3837.39s] But if you're so busy going,
[3837.39s - 3838.75s] oh, well, Jane launched a podcast
[3838.75s - 3839.79s] and there's too many podcasts.
[3839.79s - 3841.23s] Now I can't launch a podcast.
[3842.21s - 3843.17s] Who's blocking you?
[3843.65s - 3844.21s] You.
[3844.21s - 3844.69s] Correct.
[3845.65s - 3849.65s] You're capable of learning to be a better player
[3849.65s - 3851.97s] in the game of life from other people.
[3851.97s - 3852.21s] Yes.
[3853.01s - 3856.77s] So stop playing against them and let them show you the way.
[3857.17s - 3862.05s] Mel, why is it so hard to make friends as we get older?
[3862.85s - 3867.17s] There is a massive shift that happens in adult friendship
[3867.17s - 3869.81s] when you hit 20 that nobody sees coming.
[3869.81s - 3872.29s] The rules of friendship completely change
[3872.29s - 3873.25s] when you're 20s hit.
[3873.25s - 3876.13s] And I'm going to explain the rules when you're little
[3876.13s - 3878.37s] and then we're going to talk about the rules of adult friendship.
[3879.01s - 3883.01s] So when you're little, your entire life is organized
[3883.01s - 3885.49s] around friendship and making it possible
[3885.49s - 3888.05s] because you're with people your age all the time
[3888.05s - 3889.25s] in class and sports.
[3889.25s - 3889.89s] So true.
[3889.89s - 3893.33s] You move in groups because you're on teams
[3893.33s - 3896.05s] and you're in neighborhoods and you're always together.
[3896.05s - 3897.73s] You also celebrate the same milestones.
[3897.73s - 3898.93s] You're hitting the same birthdays.
[3898.93s - 3900.77s] You're all talking about the next level of school
[3900.77s - 3901.97s] or this thing this summer.
[3901.97s - 3904.13s] You're watching the same movies because you're all the same age.
[3904.13s - 3906.53s] And so there's so much synergy and relevance
[3906.53s - 3909.81s] and the conditions to spend a ton of time together are there.
[3909.81s - 3912.85s] Then you get to university and you spend even more time together.
[3913.33s - 3916.85s] And what happens when you hit your 20s, right,
[3917.41s - 3919.73s] is that it moves from this big group sport
[3919.73s - 3921.89s] where you just kind of expect to be around your friends all the time.
[3922.45s - 3924.13s] You expect the group to get invited
[3924.13s - 3925.57s] because that's what's always happened.
[3925.57s - 3926.77s] You expect to see them all the time
[3926.77s - 3928.21s] because you do always see them all the time.
[3928.77s - 3931.25s] But then your 20s hit, the rules change
[3931.25s - 3933.97s] and what I call the great scattering happens.
[3933.97s - 3935.89s] Everybody moves in different directions.
[3935.89s - 3939.41s] And friendship goes from group sport to individual sport.
[3940.38s - 3942.14s] You can no longer expect friendship.
[3943.34s - 3945.74s] You are no longer part of a group
[3945.74s - 3947.82s] that is expected to be invited everywhere
[3947.82s - 3949.34s] because everybody scatters.
[3949.34s - 3951.66s] And suddenly everybody's on different timelines.
[3951.66s - 3952.86s] You're in different cities.
[3952.86s - 3954.46s] You're moving in different directions.
[3954.46s - 3957.74s] So there's no way to locate yourself inside your friend group.
[3958.30s - 3960.46s] And the only thing that's keeping you together
[3960.46s - 3962.70s] from your friends from your little is a text chain
[3962.70s - 3965.10s] that starts to go quieter and quieter and quieter
[3965.10s - 3967.74s] as people start to focus on the people in front of them.
[3968.30s - 3970.30s] And that brings me to two major shifts
[3970.30s - 3972.70s] that I want you to embrace using the let them theory.
[3973.34s - 3975.34s] Number one, you can no longer expect friendship.
[3976.24s - 3979.12s] You have to take a way more flexible approach
[3979.12s - 3980.72s] and a more proactive approach.
[3980.72s - 3983.68s] You got to let people come and go.
[3984.80s - 3986.16s] Super important.
[3986.16s - 3988.72s] And then you got to let me take the actions
[3988.72s - 3990.16s] to create the friendships.
[3990.16s - 3991.20s] I got to go first.
[3991.20s - 3992.32s] I got to be the one planning.
[3992.32s - 3993.60s] I got to seek out new people.
[3994.16s - 3997.44s] But there are three pillars of adult friendship
[3997.44s - 3998.80s] based on research
[3998.80s - 4001.20s] that are also going to help you understand
[4001.20s - 4003.28s] that when people come and go in your life,
[4003.28s - 4005.68s] 99% of the time, it's not personal.
[4006.70s - 4008.62s] And you actually haven't lost them as a friend.
[4009.58s - 4011.18s] One of the three pillars is missing.
[4011.74s - 4014.22s] So the three things that need to be required
[4014.22s - 4015.98s] to have a friendship happen
[4015.98s - 4017.90s] are the same three things that were around
[4017.90s - 4018.94s] all the time when you were a kid.
[4018.94s - 4020.46s] Number one, proximity.
[4020.46s - 4023.26s] Proximity matters tremendously.
[4023.26s - 4026.62s] Proximity means who are you actually physically next to?
[4026.62s - 4028.54s] In fact, they've done research, Jay.
[4028.54s - 4031.74s] If you and I were in a dorm and we lived across the hall,
[4031.74s - 4033.66s] I don't remember the percentages exactly,
[4033.66s - 4036.22s] but it's like 90% chance we're going to be friends.
[4036.22s - 4036.70s] Interesting.
[4036.70s - 4038.86s] The poorer person at the end of the hallway,
[4039.50s - 4041.34s] 10% chance that we're going to be friends with them
[4041.34s - 4042.78s] because of proximity.
[4042.78s - 4045.02s] Even a matter of 50 feet makes a difference.
[4045.66s - 4047.26s] And so when you were little,
[4047.26s - 4049.74s] you were in proximity to people your age all the time.
[4049.74s - 4050.46s] All day.
[4050.46s - 4050.94s] Exactly.
[4051.50s - 4055.18s] The research also shows that to have as an adult
[4055.18s - 4056.54s] a kind of casual friend,
[4056.54s - 4059.02s] you need to spend approximately 70 hours with somebody.
[4059.82s - 4061.82s] To have a close friend, 200 hours.
[4062.94s - 4065.26s] So when you're an adult, that creates a big problem
[4065.82s - 4068.78s] because who are you spending all your time with once you're 20?
[4068.78s - 4071.42s] The American time study shows that it's with people you work with.
[4072.06s - 4074.30s] So why aren't we best friends with people at work?
[4074.30s - 4075.90s] Because you have proximity
[4075.90s - 4077.66s] and you're spending a lot of time together,
[4077.66s - 4078.86s] but here's the thing, timing.
[4079.66s - 4080.46s] When you were little,
[4080.46s - 4082.94s] you were in the same timing of life with everybody.
[4082.94s - 4083.74s] Yeah.
[4083.74s - 4086.22s] When you hit your 20s and it's now individual,
[4087.10s - 4088.94s] everybody's on different timelines.
[4088.94s - 4090.22s] Some of your friends are getting married.
[4090.22s - 4091.58s] Some are going to graduate school.
[4091.58s - 4094.22s] Some are now pursuing jobs.
[4094.22s - 4096.78s] Other people are moving out of the city, into the city.
[4096.78s - 4099.02s] Everybody's timing is now different.
[4099.02s - 4101.58s] And this also explains why you're almost never best friends
[4101.58s - 4104.62s] with people at work because the timing is off.
[4104.62s - 4105.82s] You're sitting next to people
[4105.82s - 4108.62s] that are in very different times of their life.
[4108.62s - 4113.58s] You may like them a lot and you may be friends,
[4113.58s - 4115.58s] but you never spend time outside of work
[4116.14s - 4118.38s] because they're at home with their family
[4118.94s - 4121.50s] and you're going out with your buddies your age on the weekends.
[4122.38s - 4124.54s] And then that brings me to the third thing
[4124.54s - 4126.70s] that needs to be present for a friendship
[4126.70s - 4128.62s] to truly click and that's energy.
[4129.66s - 4131.58s] And the thing about energy is it changes.
[4132.67s - 4135.39s] And you can have fantastic energy with somebody
[4135.39s - 4137.39s] and then if you decide you're not drinking anymore,
[4137.39s - 4138.19s] the energy's off.
[4138.91s - 4140.99s] If you decide to get really focused on fitness,
[4140.99s - 4141.79s] the energy's off.
[4142.59s - 4144.75s] If you have very different political beliefs,
[4144.75s - 4145.95s] the energy's off.
[4145.95s - 4146.91s] It's not personal.
[4147.71s - 4149.07s] It's one of these three pillars
[4149.07s - 4151.15s] and it has helped me so profoundly, Jay,
[4151.90s - 4154.62s] to realize that people come and go
[4154.62s - 4156.62s] and it's a beautiful thing and you should let them.
[4157.74s - 4158.70s] And you should really,
[4158.70s - 4161.82s] if you have a friendship that starts to dissipate, right?
[4162.72s - 4165.36s] Ask yourself before you blame them or you blame you,
[4166.54s - 4170.00s] are any one of these three pillars missing?
[4171.71s - 4173.47s] Are we not near each other anymore?
[4174.98s - 4176.58s] Is the timing of our lives off?
[4177.22s - 4179.78s] Is there just something about the energy that hasn't clicked?
[4180.74s - 4182.98s] Because you can't force those things.
[4182.98s - 4185.70s] But what I've found is that when you recognize
[4185.70s - 4188.18s] that those are really important factors
[4189.06s - 4191.22s] to your connection to someone else,
[4192.32s - 4195.04s] that if a friendship starts to fade for me,
[4195.04s - 4196.72s] it's so easy to say let them
[4196.72s - 4199.04s] and I don't wish anybody bad.
[4199.76s - 4201.44s] I literally wish people well.
[4202.08s - 4203.76s] Because the other thing that I've learned,
[4203.76s - 4205.36s] and being 56,
[4206.00s - 4207.68s] I've had a lot of friends come and go
[4207.68s - 4209.12s] in different phases of my life,
[4210.00s - 4213.28s] that you would be startled by how many people
[4213.28s - 4215.68s] from your past that you no longer quote,
[4215.68s - 4217.60s] consider friends because you haven't seen them
[4217.60s - 4220.00s] in a very long time or things just got weird.
[4220.00s - 4221.44s] If you actually called them,
[4222.16s - 4223.12s] they'd pick up the phone.
[4223.12s - 4223.76s] They would.
[4223.76s - 4224.88s] If you texted them,
[4225.60s - 4228.32s] the research shows that when you get a surprise text
[4228.32s - 4230.32s] from somebody that you haven't heard from in a long time,
[4230.32s - 4232.24s] the amount of joy that you feel.
[4232.88s - 4234.40s] And so I want you to consider
[4234.40s - 4235.68s] if you're very lonely right now,
[4235.68s - 4237.60s] that there's actually probably hundreds of people
[4237.60s - 4239.52s] from your past that still consider you a friend.
[4240.32s - 4242.56s] And if you take the approach that I'm talking about,
[4242.56s - 4245.20s] which is friendship is your responsibility.
[4245.76s - 4246.72s] You need to go first.
[4247.28s - 4251.36s] Let me create the friendship and the connection that I want.
[4251.36s - 4256.48s] And you can start by literally taking a look through your past
[4256.48s - 4259.04s] and thinking about people that you remember fondly
[4259.04s - 4260.56s] and just sending them a text.
[4261.12s - 4263.68s] And you will be startled by what comes back.
[4264.66s - 4265.94s] Because they're there.
[4265.94s - 4267.70s] They haven't actually gone anywhere.
[4267.70s - 4268.98s] The connection is still there.
[4268.98s - 4270.98s] And oftentimes, even if you've had somebody where
[4271.54s - 4272.42s] something's been off,
[4273.60s - 4276.08s] again, let them and wish them well.
[4276.96s - 4279.68s] And there will be a time, I promise you,
[4280.24s - 4283.84s] where the timing or proximity or energy comes back around again.
[4283.84s - 4284.16s] Yeah.
[4284.16s - 4285.44s] And often you're so right.
[4286.24s - 4289.20s] As I'm listening to you talk, I'm just thinking of
[4290.00s - 4293.04s] how conscious we have to be with all of our relationships,
[4293.04s - 4294.16s] the ones that matter to us,
[4294.16s - 4296.00s] the ones that we want to invest in.
[4296.64s - 4297.52s] And it's what you said.
[4298.72s - 4303.25s] We were actually dealt such a tough card
[4303.25s - 4308.13s] in the fact that basically from the moment you joined school at four
[4308.85s - 4311.17s] till the moment you were 21, if you went to college,
[4311.73s - 4315.73s] you basically didn't have to make really any major decisions
[4316.45s - 4318.77s] or think about the next step.
[4318.77s - 4320.53s] Because you went from seventh grade to eighth grade
[4320.53s - 4322.13s] to ninth grade to whatever it is.
[4323.09s - 4328.37s] And so then all of a sudden you're in the world at 21 or 18,
[4328.37s - 4329.57s] if you didn't go to college,
[4329.57s - 4332.13s] and you all of a sudden now have to figure out what to do
[4332.13s - 4334.29s] for the next 50, 60 years.
[4334.29s - 4336.29s] All structure of your life just evaporates.
[4336.29s - 4338.69s] It just disappears because there is no structure
[4338.69s - 4339.81s] and it makes no sense.
[4340.61s - 4343.73s] And as I'm hearing you talk, it sounds like to me
[4344.53s - 4347.33s] that it would have been harder to watch your daughter have to practice
[4347.33s - 4351.81s] the let them theory than it is for you to practice the let them theory.
[4351.89s - 4352.53s] Yes.
[4352.53s - 4353.73s] When she was going through her break up.
[4353.73s - 4354.37s] Yes.
[4354.37s - 4359.41s] Would you say that in your deep vicinity of people that you're close with,
[4360.13s - 4363.65s] the hardest way you've had to practice the let them theory?
[4363.65s - 4363.97s] Yes.
[4363.97s - 4368.29s] The hardest way is when you recognize the potential in somebody
[4369.47s - 4371.39s] and you see them struggling.
[4372.11s - 4376.27s] And when you recognize that somebody that you love deeply is in pain.
[4376.91s - 4380.03s] When you're saying let them, you're not abandoning somebody.
[4380.67s - 4383.63s] You're actually recognizing their ability
[4384.54s - 4388.22s] to meet these difficult moments in their life with you by their side.
[4389.58s - 4394.30s] And I think when I think about supporting versus enabling,
[4394.30s - 4398.30s] because the more you kind of step in and rescue people from their feelings
[4398.30s - 4401.34s] or from the consequences of their decisions or their inaction,
[4402.06s - 4405.74s] the more people continue to drown in their problems.
[4405.74s - 4406.62s] I really believe that.
[4406.62s - 4407.34s] I do too.
[4407.34s - 4408.22s] I really believe that.
[4408.22s - 4410.86s] And it's a very, very difficult balance
[4410.86s - 4414.06s] because you're going to hit your frustration and rock bottom
[4414.06s - 4415.98s] and worry with somebody before they do.
[4417.23s - 4420.51s] And somebody said something in the addiction community.
[4420.51s - 4421.87s] I can't remember who said this,
[4422.43s - 4425.47s] but it just is so true that somebody only gets sober
[4425.47s - 4428.94s] when getting drunk is harder than facing the thing
[4429.74s - 4431.74s] that they don't want to face.
[4432.86s - 4435.34s] And the same is true with anything.
[4435.98s - 4439.26s] Like really motivating yourself to get in better shape,
[4440.80s - 4443.04s] recognizing that you have a pattern of dating people
[4443.04s - 4445.60s] that are emotionally abusive and taking a break
[4445.60s - 4450.40s] and really digging deep into the issue that keeps coming up for you.
[4450.40s - 4451.36s] That's really hard.
[4451.36s - 4452.40s] That's why we avoid it.
[4453.44s - 4457.12s] And so when you see somebody that you know is capable
[4457.12s - 4461.12s] or who deserves better, wanting that for them is a form of loving them.
[4461.76s - 4465.84s] You should want the people in your life that you care about
[4465.84s - 4466.88s] to be doing better.
[4466.88s - 4472.64s] And I hate seeing somebody with so much potential squandering it.
[4473.52s - 4475.44s] But again, I'm going to come back to something that I learned
[4475.44s - 4478.32s] from Dr. Stuart Ablon at Mass General Hospital.
[4479.34s - 4480.46s] People do well when they can.
[4481.34s - 4483.82s] And I want you to start to assume that if somebody in your life
[4483.82s - 4487.76s] is not doing well or if they're going through a challenge,
[4488.48s - 4489.92s] there is a skill that's missing
[4489.92s - 4492.48s] or there is emotion that needs to be processed
[4492.48s - 4494.32s] or there is pain that needs to be felt
[4494.96s - 4501.68s] before they can galvanize the ability to do the very difficult work to change.
[4502.48s - 4505.52s] And in the case of watching my daughter go through this heartbreak,
[4506.42s - 4509.94s] I mean, I literally found myself, Jay, wanting to text
[4510.58s - 4512.74s] you know her boyfriend or boyfriend's mother like,
[4512.74s - 4515.94s] you know, hey me we can like just because I want to fix it.
[4515.94s - 4520.10s] But when you step in and fix it, you literally demean someone else
[4521.01s - 4523.89s] because I do know that she has the ability
[4524.53s - 4525.49s] to move through this.
[4525.49s - 4528.21s] And so the way that I love thinking about support is this way.
[4529.01s - 4530.61s] The next time you have somebody in your life
[4531.54s - 4534.74s] who is truly struggling, whether it's in school or in relationships
[4534.74s - 4536.74s] or with an addiction, I want you to think,
[4537.54s - 4543.30s] how can I create an environment that supports their healing?
[4545.06s - 4546.98s] Not stepping in and doing it.
[4546.98s - 4548.58s] It's rarely an issue of will.
[4548.58s - 4550.90s] Like it's not willpower for people or the desire.
[4550.90s - 4554.58s] It's actually more about skill and the ability
[4554.66s - 4557.70s] and need to process things and do it on their own timeline.
[4559.22s - 4561.70s] So how can you create an environment for that to happen?
[4561.70s - 4565.30s] And for me, it meant removing any imagery.
[4565.30s - 4567.46s] It meant letting her stay up in her bedroom
[4567.46s - 4569.30s] and every once in a while knocking on the door
[4569.30s - 4570.26s] and being like, do you need anything?
[4571.44s - 4574.32s] And allowing her to be in her pajamas for four days
[4574.32s - 4576.72s] and be in a depressive state because guess what?
[4576.72s - 4579.76s] Being in a depressive state and falling on the floor and crying.
[4580.48s - 4582.08s] It's a sign she's mentally well.
[4583.49s - 4584.45s] That's what you do.
[4585.17s - 4587.01s] It's a sign that you're okay.
[4587.89s - 4588.21s] Yes.
[4588.93s - 4591.09s] It would be scary if she wasn't feeling anything.
[4592.29s - 4596.21s] And then when you're ready, you kind of put your armor on people.
[4596.21s - 4597.17s] And so how can you do this?
[4597.17s - 4599.73s] Like when she was born actually, Sawyer,
[4600.61s - 4602.93s] I had severe postpartum depression, Jay.
[4602.93s - 4605.57s] I had a very traumatic delivery, lost a lot of blood,
[4605.57s - 4611.25s] and I just was so out of it that they put me on these drugs
[4611.25s - 4612.45s] that turned me into a zombie.
[4612.45s - 4613.41s] I couldn't breastfeed her.
[4613.41s - 4614.77s] I wasn't allowed to be alone with her.
[4615.17s - 4617.25s] I missed the first three and a half months of her life.
[4618.34s - 4622.85s] And nobody asked me if I needed help.
[4624.08s - 4628.48s] They showed up and created an environment where I could get better.
[4629.31s - 4631.55s] I had my parents drive out and just stay.
[4631.55s - 4633.23s] And they just did laundry and they cleaned
[4633.23s - 4634.27s] and they did what needed to be done.
[4635.33s - 4639.41s] And people who are struggling, they don't even know what they need.
[4640.48s - 4643.12s] And so don't ask somebody what you can do.
[4644.42s - 4645.62s] Find something you can do.
[4646.83s - 4647.87s] Show up with a meal.
[4649.12s - 4651.36s] Walk into your brother's bedroom
[4651.36s - 4653.68s] and pull open the curtains in the morning
[4653.68s - 4656.80s] when he's struggling with depression so the sunlight comes in.
[4656.80s - 4658.48s] Create a playlist for somebody.
[4659.58s - 4660.30s] Pick them up.
[4660.30s - 4661.82s] Like don't say you want to meet at yoga.
[4661.82s - 4663.02s] Say here's what we're going to do.
[4663.02s - 4665.18s] I'm going to come over on Saturday and pick you up
[4665.18s - 4667.10s] and we're going to go to that yoga class.
[4667.10s - 4668.62s] Or I'm going to come over on Sunday
[4668.62s - 4670.78s] and I'm going to watch the kids and the dog
[4670.78s - 4673.02s] so you can go to the park and read a book for two hours.
[4673.90s - 4676.14s] That's how you create an environment
[4676.86s - 4678.46s] for someone else to get better.
[4679.18s - 4682.22s] And the other way that you do it is instead of judging,
[4683.02s - 4685.26s] you're going to let them be who they are.
[4685.26s - 4686.62s] You're going to let them struggle.
[4686.62s - 4688.94s] And then you're going to use this technique
[4688.94s - 4690.30s] that's incredibly effective.
[4690.30s - 4693.66s] I labeled it the ABC so that I could remember it.
[4694.22s - 4695.66s] First you're going to apologize.
[4695.66s - 4698.14s] So let's talk about like this is an issue I had with our son.
[4698.70s - 4700.22s] He didn't seem motivated.
[4700.22s - 4702.70s] So I would constantly be like, why aren't you motivated?
[4702.70s - 4703.74s] Why don't you study hard?
[4703.74s - 4704.54s] Why are you doing this?
[4705.74s - 4706.70s] It didn't work.
[4706.70s - 4707.74s] Yeah, it doesn't work.
[4707.74s - 4707.98s] No.
[4708.78s - 4713.23s] And so I finally, A, you're going to apologize.
[4713.23s - 4714.51s] I'm sorry I'm pressuring you.
[4715.23s - 4716.67s] I'm sorry I'm questioning you.
[4717.49s - 4719.81s] And then A, you're going to ask an open-ended question.
[4720.56s - 4722.88s] How do you feel about this issue?
[4723.90s - 4725.26s] And it doesn't matter what they say
[4726.06s - 4728.22s] because you're probably asking for the first time
[4728.78s - 4730.54s] how they actually feel about the issue.
[4731.26s - 4733.10s] And then you're going to ask a really important question.
[4733.10s - 4735.02s] You're going to ask, what would you like to do about it,
[4735.02s - 4735.58s] if anything?
[4736.14s - 4737.66s] And their answers don't matter
[4737.66s - 4739.58s] because what you're doing by apologizing
[4739.58s - 4741.50s] is you're removing the pressure that you're bringing.
[4742.42s - 4743.86s] And now by asking these questions,
[4743.86s - 4747.22s] and I like to do this in a car jay because they're trapped.
[4747.94s - 4750.42s] And because you're both looking ahead
[4750.42s - 4752.82s] so it's not as confrontational.
[4752.82s - 4754.10s] And there's something in the science
[4754.10s - 4756.26s] around forward ambulation and the movement
[4756.26s - 4758.10s] that actually opens up your thinking.
[4759.46s - 4765.18s] And then you ask, what do you want to do about it, if anything?
[4765.90s - 4770.30s] And what happens is you're now revealing this tension
[4770.30s - 4772.22s] because people that are stuck know it.
[4772.22s - 4773.42s] People that are struggling know it.
[4773.42s - 4774.94s] People who are failing at school know it.
[4774.94s - 4776.06s] Nobody wants to fail.
[4777.01s - 4779.73s] It's not like people are trying to be depressed.
[4780.37s - 4783.81s] It's not like people are trying to be very unhealthy.
[4783.81s - 4787.25s] People know when they're letting themselves go.
[4787.25s - 4788.29s] You don't need to remind them.
[4789.20s - 4790.08s] But have you ever asked them,
[4790.08s - 4791.84s] what would you like to do about this, if anything?
[4792.70s - 4795.42s] What happens in that question, whether they answered or not,
[4796.06s - 4799.34s] is that friction between what they know
[4799.34s - 4801.02s] to be true about what they desire
[4801.90s - 4804.22s] and where they actually are rises up.
[4805.12s - 4809.28s] That is the organizing intrinsic motivation
[4809.28s - 4812.96s] that somebody needs to want to do better.
[4814.08s - 4815.44s] And then you got to do B, back off.
[4816.48s - 4817.20s] That's the hard part.
[4817.20s - 4818.96s] Let them, let them, let them, let them.
[4818.96s - 4820.00s] Let me shut up.
[4820.00s - 4820.88s] Let them, let them.
[4820.88s - 4821.92s] Let me not roll my eyes.
[4822.96s - 4826.91s] And people need space to have it be their idea.
[4826.91s - 4828.43s] And I'll give you a quick example.
[4828.43s - 4831.23s] I used to be the kind of person that would eat lunch
[4831.23s - 4832.59s] and work on my computer.
[4832.59s - 4833.55s] I'm tapping on my computer,
[4833.55s - 4834.75s] shoving a sandwich on my throat.
[4835.47s - 4837.15s] And there would be this colleague
[4837.15s - 4839.15s] that would stand up and go for a walk most days.
[4839.95s - 4841.79s] And every time she came back,
[4841.79s - 4842.99s] she'd have a smile on her face
[4842.99s - 4844.19s] and she'd take her earbuds off
[4844.19s - 4845.39s] and she'd then get back to work.
[4846.11s - 4847.39s] And this would go on for weeks.
[4847.95s - 4849.39s] And then finally one day, Jay,
[4850.24s - 4852.88s] I look up outside and it's a nice day.
[4852.88s - 4854.96s] And I think, I think I'm gonna go for a walk.
[4855.52s - 4856.72s] Now, here's the interesting thing.
[4857.70s - 4858.58s] I didn't credit her.
[4859.31s - 4860.35s] I thought it was my idea.
[4861.76s - 4865.52s] Her example influenced my desire to do it.
[4865.52s - 4870.24s] The people that you are close to need enough distance from you.
[4870.24s - 4873.04s] This is why you have to back off for that friction.
[4873.68s - 4874.00s] Yeah.
[4874.80s - 4877.44s] And that stirring to sit with them
[4878.69s - 4880.93s] in order for them to feel safe
[4881.81s - 4884.61s] to be able to take the step forward.
[4884.61s - 4886.37s] And then you better keep backing off
[4886.37s - 4887.73s] because you do not want to be like,
[4887.73s - 4889.25s] oh, I saw you didn't matter in your tent.
[4889.25s - 4890.21s] Like that's kind of, no.
[4891.20s - 4892.56s] And so you keep going, let them.
[4893.28s - 4897.28s] And then the C part is any small thing,
[4897.28s - 4899.60s] you celebrate it in a non-passive aggressive way.
[4901.09s - 4903.89s] And you actually model the change.
[4903.89s - 4905.41s] You can't ask somebody to stop drinking
[4905.41s - 4906.93s] while you're pouring yourself a glass of wine.
[4906.93s - 4907.57s] For sure.
[4907.57s - 4909.33s] You can't ask somebody else to get healthy
[4909.33s - 4910.93s] if you're sitting on the couch eating chips.
[4911.49s - 4913.49s] So you model the change and make it easy,
[4913.49s - 4915.65s] just like my colleague did with the walk.
[4916.45s - 4918.93s] And just like you and I constantly buy things online
[4918.93s - 4920.45s] because it looks so easy and fun,
[4922.00s - 4923.84s] your behavior and backing off
[4923.84s - 4926.88s] and that tension inside them actually creates the space
[4926.88s - 4929.60s] for somebody to truly want to change.
[4930.96s - 4932.40s] And that's how it's done.
[4932.40s - 4935.92s] Mel, I want to thank you so deeply for writing this book.
[4936.96s - 4940.24s] The let them theory, a life changing tool
[4940.24s - 4942.24s] that millions of people can't stop talking about.
[4942.24s - 4942.88s] It's true.
[4944.08s - 4946.08s] Mel, I've learned so much from you today, honestly.
[4946.08s - 4948.64s] And you've connected so many dots to me.
[4948.64s - 4949.92s] I know I'm going to be recommending this book
[4949.92s - 4951.36s] to so many people in my life
[4951.36s - 4952.72s] because I really believe it's the thing
[4952.72s - 4953.68s] that's holding them back.
[4953.68s - 4954.24s] Yeah.
[4954.24s - 4955.36s] I want to thank you for writing it.
[4955.36s - 4957.04s] I want to thank you for pouring your heart into it.
[4957.04s - 4959.52s] I want to thank you for just showing up so brilliantly
[4959.52s - 4961.36s] and emphatically today as you always do.
[4962.08s - 4964.40s] And I'm just so grateful to call you a friend
[4964.40s - 4967.04s] and grateful to know you in this journey called life
[4967.04s - 4971.52s] and genuinely so thankful that you're constantly trying
[4971.52s - 4974.64s] to find really simple, practical tools
[4974.64s - 4976.16s] that all of us can apply in our lives
[4976.16s - 4979.12s] to make it easier and make it a bit more livable
[4979.12s - 4980.48s] but also thrive.
[4980.48s - 4982.48s] So thank you so much, truly.
[4982.48s - 4983.84s] Well, I'm not as smart as you, Jay.
[4983.84s - 4985.28s] So I can't do the intellectual stuff.
[4985.28s - 4986.40s] I got to find simple things.
[4986.40s - 4987.20s] You're kidding me?
[4987.20s - 4990.24s] Well, you know, I have to tell you, I really appreciate it.
[4990.24s - 4991.04s] Simple is beautiful.
[4991.12s - 4998.69s] And I truly accept and feel how heartfelt and honest
[4998.69s - 5003.81s] those words are because this is, I think, my legacy.
[5005.20s - 5005.60s] I do.
[5006.24s - 5010.40s] I think that this is the thing I was supposed to figure out
[5010.40s - 5011.44s] and leave the world.
[5012.32s - 5013.12s] I believe it, too.
[5013.84s - 5014.64s] Thank you.
[5014.64s - 5015.28s] Thank you.
[5015.28s - 5016.00s] You're the best.
[5016.00s - 5016.56s] So are you.
[5017.70s - 5020.58s] If you love this episode, you'll love my interview
[5020.58s - 5024.58s] with Dr. Gabor Matei on understanding your trauma
[5024.58s - 5029.14s] and how to heal emotional wounds to start moving on from the past.
[5029.14s - 5031.22s] Everything in nature grows only where it's vulnerable.
[5031.22s - 5034.26s] So a tree doesn't grow where it's hard and thick, does it?
[5034.26s - 5036.66s] It goes where it's soft and green and vulnerable.
