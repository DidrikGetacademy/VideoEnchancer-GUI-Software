[0.00s - 1.04s] I think if people are like,
[1.04s - 3.20s] I want to accomplish this goal,
[3.20s - 4.92s] the very next question is why?
[4.92s - 6.80s] And then go, why, why, why, why, why?
[6.80s - 8.32s] If your why is so strong,
[8.32s - 9.48s] how it's gonna be done,
[9.48s - 10.52s] it doesn't matter,
[10.52s - 11.36s] you'll figure out.
[11.36s - 13.16s] You've got a book out called Level Up.

[17.04s - 18.12s] Not everything that's happened to you
[18.12s - 19.16s] in your life is your fault,
[19.16s - 20.28s] but whatever it is that you have,
[20.28s - 21.84s] it is your responsibility to work through.
[21.84s - 23.32s] If I'm gonna feel the feelings of fear,
[23.32s - 24.64s] why don't I also just try
[24.64s - 26.96s] feeling the feelings of success in getting there?

[68.41s - 69.25s] Jay Shetty.
[69.25s - 73.57s] The one, the only.
[73.57s - 76.49s] Why is it that we all want something?
[76.49s - 77.49s] We have goals.
[77.49s - 81.27s] We have things that we believe are important,
[81.27s - 83.51s] but we struggle to focus on them.
[83.51s - 85.51s] Yeah, well, there's a couple of different things.
[85.51s - 87.59s] I think the first thing is that we hold ourselves back
[87.59s - 89.07s] from is we have a lot of fears.
[89.11s - 92.11s] And fears when you really start to dive into them.
[92.11s - 93.99s] Like you mentioned in the beginning of this,
[93.99s - 96.43s] like I started talking with you about like the East
[96.43s - 99.03s] and you started, I remember you told me in 2017,
[99.03s - 100.27s] like you should read the Bhagavad Gita.
[100.27s - 101.47s] So I literally wrote it.
[101.47s - 102.95s] I got it like the next week and read it
[102.95s - 104.27s] while we were traveling.
[104.27s - 105.19s] And so there was that.
[105.19s - 106.75s] And as I was writing the book, I was like,
[106.75s - 107.87s] what's the thing?
[107.87s - 108.91s] Because your title of the book was
[108.91s - 110.55s] a psychology of taking action.
[110.55s - 112.43s] Cause I was looking at the mindset mentor podcast.
[112.43s - 114.55s] I have 1400 episodes and I was like,
[114.55s - 117.55s] it's just me speaking for almost every single one of them.
[117.55s - 118.87s] And I was like, what do I teach?
[119.55s - 121.27s] What do people want from me?
[121.27s - 123.71s] And I was like, it's almost all like tips and tricks,
[123.71s - 125.35s] understand yourself to take action.
[125.35s - 127.63s] Because everybody who's listening to a podcast
[127.63s - 129.19s] has the awareness of I want to improve.
[129.19s - 130.03s] I want to get better.
[130.03s - 132.91s] I want something different, but how do I do it?
[132.91s - 134.47s] And so I started saying, okay,
[134.47s - 137.07s] if taking action is what the book's going to be about,
[137.07s - 139.11s] like why don't people take action in the first place?
[139.11s - 141.23s] And one of the things that pops up for people is fear.
[141.23s - 142.07s] Like there's just,
[142.07s - 143.75s] there's some sort of fear that pops up for them.
[143.75s - 145.99s] And I had a conversation with one of my friends
[146.03s - 147.67s] who went and lived in the tribe,
[147.67s - 149.43s] with a tribe, a native Brazilian tribe
[149.43s - 150.91s] in the middle of Brazil.
[150.91s - 152.63s] And so he had to fly into a town.
[152.63s - 153.47s] He had to hop on a boat
[153.47s - 155.91s] and go for two days on a boat in the middle of nowhere.
[155.91s - 157.19s] And he started talking to me about these things
[157.19s - 159.59s] that he called primal fears and intellectual fears.
[159.59s - 162.73s] So like a primal fear is pain or death is attached to it.
[162.73s - 164.99s] And we don't really come up with too many primal fears
[164.99s - 166.35s] in our life nowadays.
[166.35s - 169.53s] Intellectual fear is like what we deal with all day long,
[169.53s - 172.87s] which is, you know, the fear of rejection,
[172.87s - 175.83s] the fear of failure, the fear of not being accepted,
[175.83s - 177.39s] the fear of success.
[177.39s - 178.31s] We have all these fears
[178.31s - 180.75s] and all of these fears are made up in our minds.
[180.75s - 181.83s] And so I was listening to,
[181.83s - 184.05s] I'm pretty sure it was Sadguru I was listening to.
[184.05s - 185.59s] And I was like, I put on,
[185.59s - 186.91s] and I was driving around in Sedona
[186.91s - 188.15s] as I was writing the book.
[188.15s - 190.51s] I was there just to try to get my whole mind together
[190.51s - 192.07s] to buy myself writing it.
[192.07s - 193.55s] And I was like, looking at fears
[193.55s - 194.75s] and trying to figure them out.
[194.75s - 196.63s] And one thing that he said that like really hit me
[196.63s - 199.63s] more than anything else is,
[199.63s - 201.11s] okay, I've identified my fears.
[201.11s - 203.47s] And the next thing is, well, how do I overcome these fears?
[203.47s - 205.61s] And if it's an intellectual fear,
[206.21s - 207.65s] the fears that exist in our minds
[207.65s - 210.61s] is you can't overcome something that doesn't exist.
[210.61s - 212.01s] And so we create,
[212.01s - 214.01s] we basically wake up in the morning,
[214.01s - 214.85s] we create the boogeyman,
[214.85s - 217.09s] which is like the fear of success,
[217.09s - 218.13s] the fear of failure, whatever it is.
[218.13s - 219.53s] And instead of actually taking the action
[219.53s - 221.89s] that we need to and focusing on what it is that we want,
[221.89s - 223.33s] we take all of our focus
[223.33s - 225.33s] and put it towards trying to overcome this fear.
[225.33s - 226.93s] When in reality, the fear doesn't even exist
[226.93s - 228.05s] in the first place.
[228.05s - 230.61s] And so I think the biggest thing for most people is like,
[230.61s - 233.89s] the fear is keeping you from focusing.
[233.89s - 236.53s] But there's also like the identity of who you think you are.
[236.53s - 239.01s] And one of my favorite things is challenging
[239.01s - 240.96s] who I think I am all the time.
[240.96s - 245.00s] Like I love the story and I put in the book of Jim Carrey
[245.00s - 248.88s] when he decided to be a man on the moon.
[248.88s - 251.24s] And the man on the moon was a movie
[251.24s - 253.80s] where he ended up playing Andy Kaufman.
[253.80s - 256.84s] And there was a whole documentary that was done on this
[256.84s - 258.36s] and they curbed it for like 20 years
[258.36s - 261.56s] because it was so off the rails of how crazy he went.
[261.56s - 263.36s] And what he did was he,
[263.36s - 264.96s] it's a documentary called Jim and Andy
[264.96s - 267.84s] that's on him playing the role on man on the moon.
[267.84s - 270.56s] So Andy Kaufman was a guy who was once alive.
[270.56s - 272.32s] And the crazy part about Andy Kaufman
[272.32s - 273.80s] is he also played other characters.
[273.80s - 276.12s] So it was Jim Carrey playing Andy Kaufman
[276.12s - 278.92s] who played like Tony Clifton and other characters.
[278.92s - 280.12s] But the thing that happened with him
[280.12s - 282.68s] was that he would never break character.
[282.68s - 283.80s] So he was a method actor.
[283.80s - 288.12s] So for four months, he played as this real life person.
[288.12s - 289.76s] And even to the point where his driver
[289.76s - 291.24s] that would pick him up in Hollywood
[291.24s - 292.68s] and drive him to his house
[292.68s - 294.96s] said that whoever he was playing
[294.96s - 296.36s] at the time that they stopped recording
[296.36s - 298.32s] whether it was Andy Kaufman, Tony Clifton,
[298.32s - 299.88s] he would play that person the entire day
[299.88s - 301.96s] when he was driving him home that night
[301.96s - 304.32s] and he'd pick him up and he was still the same person,
[304.32s - 306.08s] not Jim Carrey anymore.
[306.08s - 308.76s] And so what happened was he ended up like
[308.76s - 310.96s] and it gets kind of crazy where he ends up
[310.96s - 314.84s] doing therapy sessions with Andy Kaufman's real daughter
[314.84s - 315.72s] and his family.
[315.72s - 318.16s] So like help them overcome his sudden death.
[318.16s - 320.60s] And so what happens is they stopped recording
[320.60s - 323.84s] four months later and he's like, I don't know who I am.
[323.84s - 326.08s] And he lost who he was.
[326.08s - 327.32s] And he's like, I don't know my beliefs.
[327.32s - 329.24s] I don't know what makes me happy, what makes me sad,
[329.24s - 330.76s] what pisses me off anymore.
[330.76s - 334.04s] He's like, I've kind of just lost who Jim Carrey is.
[334.04s - 335.80s] And that's kind of like his spiritual awakening
[335.80s - 337.84s] that you've seen him go through over the past 20 years.
[337.84s - 340.80s] And he realized if I can lose Jim Carrey
[340.80s - 342.48s] then who the hell is Jim Carrey?
[342.48s - 345.12s] And he realized that Jim Carrey is just basically a character
[345.12s - 347.52s] that he's playing all the time
[347.52s - 349.34s] that is completely somebody else.
[349.34s - 350.70s] And he could just wake up another morning
[350.70s - 352.06s] and act like he's somebody else.
[352.06s - 353.38s] And so I think that two of the things
[353.38s - 355.08s] that really keep us from focusing on stuff
[355.08s - 358.14s] is we get really afraid and fearful of making change
[358.14s - 359.54s] or judgment or failure and all that.
[359.54s - 361.22s] And the other thing is like who we actually
[361.22s - 363.22s] truly think we are.
[363.22s - 364.90s] We'll hold us back from taking either the action
[364.90s - 367.42s] that we need to or staying in the exact same position
[367.42s - 368.26s] that we're in.
[368.26s - 369.10s] I love that.
[369.10s - 369.92s] I wanna go down both of those routes
[369.92s - 373.55s] because I find them both fascinating for different reasons.
[373.55s - 375.71s] And I wanna go down that more spiritual
[375.71s - 376.91s] or theory or journey as well.
[376.91s - 377.75s] Let's do it.
[377.75s - 378.59s] Because yeah.
[378.59s - 379.43s] But before we do that
[380.43s - 381.27s] I wanna make sure that,
[381.27s - 383.99s] so if we talk about the fears that people are experiencing
[383.99s - 386.59s] as you said, a lot of the time it's an intellectual fear.
[386.59s - 388.91s] It's not real, but it feels so real.
[388.91s - 389.75s] Feels real, yeah.
[389.75s - 390.59s] Right?
[390.59s - 391.43s] Like when someone says like,
[391.43s - 395.07s] oh, I'm really scared about what if I get rejected
[395.07s - 396.95s] from the job or I'm really scared
[396.95s - 398.91s] that my partner's gonna leave me
[398.91s - 403.71s] or I'm really scared that I don't feel good enough
[403.71s - 407.19s] or smart enough to make it in whatever field it is.
[407.19s - 409.27s] Those feel extremely real.
[409.71s - 413.63s] How do you process a feeling that feels real
[413.63s - 415.39s] even though it may be intellectual?
[415.39s - 416.23s] Yeah.
[416.23s - 417.67s] Well, so that's the beautiful thing about being a human.
[417.67s - 418.51s] And I think it's,
[418.51s - 419.51s] and you can correct me if I'm wrong,
[419.51s - 421.31s] but I think it's actually the Bhagavad Gita
[421.31s - 423.87s] gives an example of a lion attacking you
[423.87s - 426.07s] or a tiger attacking you at night.
[426.07s - 427.91s] And one of the examples I give in the book
[427.91s - 429.11s] is similar to that where it's like,
[429.11s - 430.07s] if you think about it,
[430.07s - 431.83s] if you, we've all had this,
[431.83s - 433.63s] we have a really intense dream.
[433.63s - 435.43s] Like you're walking in a forest, whatever it is,
[435.43s - 438.23s] and you see a lion, it starts running after you.
[438.23s - 440.91s] You run from it, you turn, you look over your shoulder,
[440.91s - 442.47s] it's getting closer, you're still running from it,
[442.47s - 443.99s] you turn, you look over your shoulder,
[443.99s - 446.67s] just as teeth are about to dig into you.
[446.67s - 448.67s] And you wake up in the middle of the night
[448.67s - 450.87s] and your body didn't move at all,
[450.87s - 453.31s] but you're sweating, you're out of breath,
[453.31s - 455.39s] your heart rate is intensely going.
[455.39s - 458.35s] And the amazing thing about being a human,
[458.35s - 461.59s] they usually say in any case is what your biggest strength is
[461.59s - 463.47s] is also can be your biggest fault.
[463.47s - 466.35s] The thing about humans is that we can project our minds
[466.39s - 468.55s] into a future that doesn't exist yet.
[468.55s - 472.39s] And so what we can do right now is we can sit here,
[472.39s - 474.91s] we're in the studio, everything is amazing.
[474.91s - 477.35s] We have food, water, shelter, clothing, everything.
[477.35s - 478.91s] But if I'm like, as a lot of people do,
[478.91s - 481.03s] like if I'm starting a business, right?
[481.03s - 482.63s] I can sit here and I can think,
[482.63s - 484.35s] well, I really wanna start this business.
[484.35s - 486.23s] But then I start playing out all of the things
[486.23s - 488.15s] that could go wrong, which is what we tend to do.
[488.15s - 490.83s] Not what goes right, but what could go wrong.
[490.83s - 493.31s] When I project my mind into that future,
[493.31s - 495.15s] the crazy part is that my mind and my body
[495.15s - 496.15s] are constantly connected.
[496.15s - 498.75s] So my brain is sending neuropeptides to my body
[498.75s - 500.75s] and creating hormones as if that moment
[500.75s - 502.95s] is actually happening right now.
[502.95s - 504.75s] And so what happens is we tend to,
[504.75s - 506.87s] as humans as a protection mechanism,
[506.87s - 509.83s] we tend to project ourself into a future
[509.83s - 511.87s] that is fearful, that is scary.
[511.87s - 513.63s] And that fearful, scary feeling
[513.63s - 516.27s] usually keeps us in the exact same place.
[516.27s - 518.27s] And so what I always say is like,
[518.27s - 520.95s] if I'm going to imagine the worst that could happen,
[520.95s - 523.23s] why don't I at least try to see the best that could happen?
[523.23s - 525.15s] And so if I'm going to notice myself,
[525.15s - 527.03s] the awareness of like, I'm really in a lot of fear
[527.03s - 529.83s] right now with starting this business.
[529.83s - 531.87s] And I'm going, man, what's the worst that could happen?
[531.87s - 532.99s] Well, then I might as well close my eyes
[532.99s - 534.63s] and say like, what's the best that could happen?
[534.63s - 537.39s] And what would it feel like to start this business
[537.39s - 539.83s] and to be able to crack a million dollars in a business?
[539.83s - 542.53s] And how proud of myself would I be
[542.53s - 545.23s] to break a million dollars in sales
[545.23s - 547.95s] and to be able to build this and travel with my family
[547.95s - 550.39s] and provide what I've always wanted to provide?
[550.39s - 552.67s] And if I'm gonna feel the feelings of fear,
[552.75s - 555.35s] why don't I also just try on feeling the feelings
[555.35s - 557.29s] of success and getting there?
[557.29s - 559.95s] And so if we notice it's an intellectual fear,
[559.95s - 563.35s] the first piece that I always say is there's three pieces,
[563.35s - 564.83s] there's the awareness of it.
[564.83s - 567.63s] Okay, I'm aware that I'm in a state of fear.
[567.63s - 570.47s] I need a practice to get myself out of that.
[570.47s - 573.15s] Okay, if I notice myself in a state of fear,
[573.15s - 575.03s] what's my practice to get myself out of it?
[575.03s - 577.35s] Well, I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna calm down
[577.35s - 581.19s] and take 60 breaths and I'm gonna connect back to my heart
[581.23s - 582.35s] and I'm gonna ask myself like,
[582.35s - 584.07s] what's the best thing that could happen?
[584.07s - 585.87s] That's the practice to get myself out of it.
[585.87s - 587.23s] And then the last piece is repetition.
[587.23s - 589.83s] So it's awareness, it's practice, it's repetition.
[589.83s - 592.83s] If I do it over and over and over again,
[592.83s - 594.47s] eventually I start to rewire myself.
[594.47s - 597.63s] So like one of the things that I found in myself years ago
[597.63s - 599.63s] that I didn't like was that I judge people.
[599.63s - 601.19s] And I'm like, man, I love people.
[601.19s - 604.31s] Like I try to be of service as much as I can,
[604.31s - 607.07s] but an immediate thought that will come in my head sometimes
[607.07s - 609.59s] is like judgment of somebody that I don't know.
[609.59s - 610.51s] And I just judge them.
[610.55s - 612.55s] And I was like, I don't like that pattern.
[612.55s - 614.59s] I wanna change this pattern within myself.
[614.59s - 617.91s] It's awareness, I become aware of what I wanna change.
[617.91s - 620.11s] And the first time I really did it,
[620.11s - 622.63s] I was at a grocery store and this guy had this like Bluetooth,
[622.63s - 624.03s] you know, like the long Bluetooth.
[624.03s - 625.55s] It was like as if he was, you know,
[625.55s - 626.87s] making cold calls at an office,
[626.87s - 628.39s] but he was at the grocery store.
[628.39s - 631.21s] And immediately the first thought in my head was judgment.
[631.21s - 632.91s] And I always say, you can't change your first thought
[632.91s - 634.19s] but you could change your second thought.
[634.19s - 637.37s] So I noticed the judgment as a first thought, awareness.
[637.37s - 639.51s] My practice that I decided for myself
[639.51s - 641.35s] was I'm gonna force myself in my head
[641.35s - 644.03s] to say three things that I like about this guy.
[644.03s - 645.67s] I paused myself in the moment.
[645.67s - 648.31s] I found myself in a pattern that I don't wanna be in anymore.
[648.31s - 650.43s] What are three things that I like about this guy?
[650.43s - 653.39s] And I said it and then I went on about my day
[653.39s - 656.47s] and I started doing this over and over and over and over again.
[656.47s - 659.55s] And one thing that I noticed is that my first thought
[659.55s - 662.67s] started changing to less judgment and more acceptance.
[662.67s - 664.79s] Cause ultimately that's what I really wanna work on
[664.79s - 668.07s] is more acceptance and loving of people and of myself.
[668.07s - 670.59s] And so I think it's becoming aware of it.
[670.59s - 672.71s] Once you're aware of the things that you're trying,
[672.71s - 673.79s] the pattern you're trying to change,
[673.79s - 676.07s] what's the practice that you're gonna take yourself down?
[676.07s - 678.07s] And then noticing that you're just gonna do it
[678.07s - 680.11s] over and over and over again.
[680.11s - 682.99s] But one of the biggest keys is to give yourself grace
[682.99s - 683.83s] as you're doing it.
[683.83s - 685.95s] Cause a lot of times we make, we become aware
[685.95s - 688.15s] and then we judge ourselves and we beat ourselves up for it.
[688.15s - 690.55s] So I think it's giving yourself a lot of loving grace
[690.55s - 692.83s] and going, hey, I've noticed this pattern.
[692.83s - 693.91s] Don't worry, we're gonna change it.
[693.91s - 696.67s] Let's go on this practice and just continuing to do that.
[696.67s - 697.83s] Yeah, it's so well said.
[697.83s - 700.47s] I think so often we get scared
[700.47s - 703.43s] even of having the thought of what could be possible
[703.43s - 705.75s] because we're scared that it can't be possible.
[705.75s - 708.63s] And we just find another thing to be fearful of.
[708.63s - 711.43s] And I love this idea of what you're saying around
[711.43s - 714.83s] transforming your thoughts because I've definitely,
[714.83s - 716.31s] the more and more I've studied books,
[716.31s - 718.99s] the more and more I've read and I've thought,
[718.99s - 723.15s] I've discovered that all of our failure and success in life
[723.15s - 725.67s] is based on our most repeated thought.
[725.71s - 727.83s] And one of my biggest questions to most people I meet now
[727.83s - 730.47s] is what is your most repeated thought?
[730.47s - 732.15s] And most people don't know the answer
[732.15s - 735.23s] because they're not aware in your words.
[735.23s - 739.51s] And a lot of people who do know will say it's something like,
[739.51s - 740.91s] I'm not good enough.
[740.91s - 743.11s] I don't like the way I look.
[743.11s - 746.99s] I am ugly, whatever else it may be for them, right?
[746.99s - 749.87s] And so we're either aware and it's negative
[749.87s - 752.75s] or we're unaware because it's so subconscious.
[752.75s - 755.35s] And I've started to recognize that most of the thoughts
[755.35s - 757.79s] that we have are not that different.
[757.79s - 760.55s] They're the same thought that comes in a different voice,
[760.55s - 763.11s] a different tone, a different vocabulary,
[763.11s - 766.55s] a different language, but it's the same repetition.
[766.55s - 768.55s] And so I've started to really think about
[768.55s - 770.95s] what's my most repeated thought?
[770.95s - 773.51s] And how can I be more, as you are saying,
[773.51s - 775.51s] how can I be more selective about it?
[775.51s - 777.67s] And how can I choose it more effectively
[777.67s - 780.11s] rather than just let it be something
[780.11s - 781.43s] that's kind of just coming up?
[781.43s - 784.51s] Yeah, and it's like, don't identify with your thoughts.
[784.51s - 786.03s] You know, like one of the things that,
[786.03s - 787.23s] I don't remember where I heard it before,
[787.23s - 789.19s] but the way I like to think about it,
[789.19s - 790.79s] and I've heard you say before,
[790.79s - 791.83s] even like a lot of people say like,
[791.83s - 793.47s] oh, I struggle with meditating.
[793.47s - 795.59s] And I've heard you say before where it's not
[795.59s - 797.07s] about mastering your thoughts,
[797.07s - 798.19s] it's not about making your thoughts go away,
[798.19s - 800.95s] it's just becoming aware of your thoughts a little bit more.
[800.95s - 802.47s] Because when we close our eyes,
[802.47s - 806.07s] you know, about 60% of our brain is visual,
[806.07s - 807.43s] for visual things to see.
[807.43s - 808.27s] So when we close our eyes,
[808.27s - 810.27s] it kind of turns off a lot of parts.
[810.27s - 811.99s] And so thoughts usually come up
[811.99s - 813.07s] and we become aware of those,
[813.07s - 815.51s] like one of the things that I've been doing a lot recently
[815.51s - 818.39s] is like trying to be in as much silence as possible.
[818.39s - 820.91s] Like I'm just trying to be as much silence
[820.91s - 821.75s] as I possibly can,
[821.75s - 823.55s] because I feel like that's where a lot of my awareness
[823.55s - 826.11s] is and a lot of my answers come from.
[826.11s - 829.03s] And so when you sit there and the analogy that I love,
[829.03s - 830.23s] when you start thinking of your thoughts,
[830.23s - 832.43s] is it's like sitting on the edge of a mountain
[832.43s - 835.91s] and down below there's just a road that you're looking at.
[835.91s - 837.63s] And sitting on the edge of the mountain
[837.63s - 839.63s] is like meditating or just sitting in silence
[839.63s - 841.47s] and just, you know, looking at your thoughts.
[841.47s - 843.05s] And you can watch the cars go by,
[843.05s - 846.25s] the thoughts that go by and not have to be attached to them.
[846.25s - 849.09s] You don't find yourself getting sucked into the red car
[849.09s - 852.21s] that just went by, you just watch that the cars go by.
[852.21s - 854.57s] And that's the way that I try to see my thoughts,
[854.57s - 856.95s] which is, okay, I'm gonna watch them go by,
[856.95s - 858.73s] I'm not gonna connect to them,
[858.73s - 860.05s] but I can look at them and be like,
[860.05s - 860.89s] is this thought,
[860.89s - 863.57s] which about 90% of our thoughts are the same as yesterday,
[863.57s - 865.13s] is this thought helping me
[865.13s - 867.09s] in trying to get to where I wanna be in life?
[867.09s - 868.69s] Or is this thought holding me back
[868.69s - 870.65s] from trying to get to where I wanna be in life?
[870.65s - 872.77s] And if it's helping me, then I want to strengthen it.
[872.77s - 875.45s] If it's not helping me, well, then, hey,
[875.45s - 876.57s] as that guy in the podcast said,
[876.57s - 878.21s] I can't control my first step, I can control my second.
[878.21s - 880.69s] So what would I prefer my second thought to be?
[880.69s - 882.53s] Yeah, I think you just hit the nail on the head.
[882.53s - 883.73s] Like that's what it is for me.
[883.73s - 886.17s] It's whether you've understood
[886.17s - 887.61s] that you're not your thoughts or not,
[887.61s - 889.03s] that can be quite hard for people
[889.03s - 891.29s] because I think we're so close to them.
[891.29s - 893.41s] But even if you can practice distance
[893.41s - 895.05s] through meditation or mindfulness,
[895.05s - 897.33s] the real win is being able to look at a thought
[897.33s - 899.01s] and say, is it good for me?
[899.01s - 899.85s] Or is it not helpful?
[899.85s - 900.69s] Like you just said,
[900.69s - 902.33s] like I think that is the wisdom of it,
[902.37s - 904.21s] that can I evaluate everything
[904.21s - 906.77s] that's repetitive in my mind
[906.77s - 908.89s] and ask myself, is this useful?
[908.89s - 910.01s] Is it helpful?
[910.01s - 912.61s] Is it allowing me to move in the direction I want?
[912.61s - 914.81s] Because chances are, a lot of what we're saying
[914.81s - 916.25s] is actually doing the complete opposite.
[916.25s - 918.01s] And then you go, oh, wait a minute,
[918.01s - 919.69s] even though it's interesting
[919.69s - 921.75s] and even though I could get lost in it,
[921.75s - 923.37s] I don't wanna waste time.
[923.37s - 925.45s] And therefore I'll move in the other direction.
[925.45s - 927.65s] You talk about procrastination in this book.
[927.65s - 930.61s] And that, again, going back to your earlier title
[930.65s - 933.69s] is a block against the psychology of action.
[933.69s - 934.69s] And we all have a friend,
[934.69s - 935.93s] or maybe we are that friend,
[935.93s - 938.13s] that constantly puts things off.
[938.13s - 941.05s] We postpone, we procrastinate.
[941.05s - 942.41s] We say, I'll do it another year.
[942.41s - 943.91s] I wanna launch a podcast.
[943.91s - 945.77s] Someone's been saying that for two years.
[945.77s - 947.01s] There's someone listening right now
[947.01s - 948.85s] who wants to start an Instagram page.
[948.85s - 950.57s] They put it off for six months.
[950.57s - 952.17s] There's someone listening who's like,
[952.17s - 953.85s] oh, I missed out on the clubhouse thing.
[953.85s - 955.45s] And then I missed out on the TikTok thing.
[955.45s - 958.01s] And now I'm missing out on whatever the next thing is.
[958.01s - 959.33s] And we procrastinate,
[959.33s - 961.77s] hoping that one day will come.
[961.77s - 964.05s] What have you learned about procrastination
[964.05s - 966.49s] through your research when you were writing the book
[966.49s - 969.47s] that has helped people break that cycle
[969.47s - 971.77s] because it seems to apply to so many of our lives?
[971.77s - 973.37s] I mean, the thing about it is this,
[973.37s - 977.05s] if I've always liked to be like very extreme in examples,
[977.05s - 978.97s] because if we can go extreme, then it makes a lot of sense.
[978.97s - 980.89s] But I always tell people like,
[980.89s - 982.61s] and I always say it like,
[982.61s - 984.69s] hey, I've given this one, I used to give a lot of speeches.
[984.69s - 985.61s] I would be in front of people and say,
[985.61s - 987.45s] hey, what's the chance of you making
[987.45s - 989.01s] a million dollars this year?
[989.01s - 989.85s] Give me numbers.
[989.85s - 992.93s] And everyone's like, 0%, 0%, 0%, 1%.
[992.93s - 994.21s] There's always 1%, it's like five.
[994.21s - 995.93s] And that's like the most it'll get to.
[995.93s - 997.97s] And I said, okay, I'm gonna give you the most extreme example,
[997.97s - 999.99s] but I just wanna see what happens, okay?
[999.99s - 1001.57s] What's the percentage chance
[1001.57s - 1004.21s] of you making a million dollars this year legally?
[1004.21s - 1007.76s] And if you don't, everyone that you love dies.
[1007.76s - 1010.52s] And everyone's like 100%, 100%, 1,000, 1,000%.
[1010.52s - 1012.00s] I said, what changed?
[1012.00s - 1013.20s] The goal didn't change.
[1013.20s - 1014.72s] The timeframe didn't change.
[1014.72s - 1016.48s] Why you're doing it changed.
[1016.48s - 1017.72s] Would you wake up in the morning
[1017.76s - 1020.20s] if everyone that you love's life depended on it
[1020.20s - 1021.64s] and be like, yeah, well,
[1021.64s - 1023.60s] maybe I should scroll on TikTok for a little while.
[1023.60s - 1025.72s] No, you'd be like, I'm gonna take action immediately.
[1025.72s - 1028.76s] And so it doesn't need to be like a fear of losing everybody,
[1028.76s - 1031.16s] but what's really behind that is like, why?
[1031.16s - 1033.12s] Like why they're doing it?
[1033.12s - 1035.80s] Like if I have a reflection of anyone who doesn't know Jay,
[1035.80s - 1038.36s] like you're one of the hardest working people I've ever met,
[1038.36s - 1040.20s] but you have a really strong why, right?
[1040.20s - 1042.04s] And that's like one of the best parts about it
[1042.04s - 1043.80s] where it's like, when I see Jay, I'm like,
[1043.80s - 1046.64s] this guy has, he has this internal feeling of like,
[1046.68s - 1048.24s] I want to change the world.
[1048.24s - 1050.24s] And you work so hard trying to do it.
[1050.24s - 1052.88s] And that's one of the most beautiful things about you
[1052.88s - 1054.56s] is like you are wanting to change the world
[1054.56s - 1056.20s] and you have a really strong why to it.
[1056.20s - 1058.84s] And I think that if most people could figure out like,
[1058.84s - 1060.68s] oh yeah, well, I wanna do this thing.
[1060.68s - 1062.00s] Why do you wanna do it?
[1062.00s - 1065.96s] And my very first one on one coach used to say to me,
[1065.96s - 1067.04s] he would say, what's your why?
[1067.04s - 1067.88s] What's your why?
[1067.88s - 1068.70s] Why are you doing this?
[1068.70s - 1069.54s] Why are you doing this?
[1069.54s - 1071.36s] He was like hammer it home in my head.
[1071.36s - 1073.08s] And I was like, why do you ask this so much?
[1073.08s - 1074.36s] And he would always say,
[1074.40s - 1076.26s] because if your why is strong enough,
[1076.26s - 1078.16s] your how will reveal itself.
[1078.16s - 1081.16s] If you know why you want to do something,
[1081.16s - 1083.56s] how it's gonna be done, you'll figure out,
[1083.56s - 1085.84s] it doesn't matter, things are gonna get in your way,
[1085.84s - 1086.76s] there's gonna be obstacles,
[1086.76s - 1087.96s] there's always gonna be obstacles,
[1087.96s - 1088.96s] there's always gonna be challenges,
[1088.96s - 1090.00s] always gonna be moments of like,
[1090.00s - 1091.64s] I don't know if I can do this.
[1091.64s - 1093.40s] But if your why is so strong,
[1093.40s - 1096.20s] it's like, I don't care what comes up in front of me,
[1096.20s - 1097.20s] I'm gonna get it done.
[1097.20s - 1100.80s] Like most people, they want to be motivated.
[1100.80s - 1103.16s] And I have come to hate the word motivation
[1103.16s - 1105.04s] because motivation is so fleeting.
[1105.04s - 1107.60s] Like we can wake up and we can listen to a podcast,
[1107.60s - 1110.00s] we can get, read something and be motivated.
[1110.00s - 1112.48s] And then something can happen to us and it's gone,
[1112.48s - 1114.20s] which just disappears.
[1114.20s - 1115.92s] What I want to be is I want to be driven.
[1115.92s - 1118.00s] Like when you see a driven person,
[1118.00s - 1119.56s] like you see it in their eyes like,
[1119.56s - 1121.82s] yeah, they're not stopping.
[1121.82s - 1123.64s] And the difference between a motivated person
[1123.64s - 1126.88s] and a driven person is that the driven person has this why
[1126.88s - 1130.20s] that they want to see have happened in the world
[1130.20s - 1132.16s] or in their life or for their family.
[1132.16s - 1133.44s] And so I think if people are like,
[1133.44s - 1135.64s] I want to accomplish this goal,
[1135.64s - 1137.60s] the very next question is why?
[1137.60s - 1139.48s] And then go, why, why, why, why, why
[1139.48s - 1140.84s] and go deeper into it.
[1140.84s - 1143.12s] An example I give in the book
[1143.12s - 1144.92s] is I had a coaching client years ago,
[1144.92s - 1146.20s] like eight, nine years ago.
[1146.20s - 1148.44s] And he was like, Rob, I want to make $100,000 this year,
[1148.44s - 1149.52s] I've never made it.
[1149.52s - 1150.56s] And I was like, why?
[1150.56s - 1152.80s] And I took him through what's called seven levels of why,
[1152.80s - 1155.20s] just keep asking why, why, why, why, why.
[1155.20s - 1157.68s] And it went from I want to make $100,000 this year
[1157.68s - 1159.36s] because I've never done it before
[1159.36s - 1163.32s] to the eventual thing was he had just got into a divorce
[1163.32s - 1164.24s] a couple of years ago.
[1164.24s - 1167.04s] Both of his young children lived in a bad part of town
[1167.04s - 1169.72s] with his ex-wife, he wanted to regain custody
[1169.72s - 1172.44s] because he was afraid that both of his children
[1172.44s - 1174.20s] would be killed in a drive-by.
[1174.20s - 1176.24s] And he was so terrified of it
[1176.24s - 1178.96s] that that was his actual true why.
[1178.96s - 1180.64s] And so it wasn't, the motivation,
[1180.64s - 1181.64s] I didn't have to talk to him say,
[1181.64s - 1184.40s] hey, you know, how close you'd make $100,000 this year?
[1184.40s - 1186.52s] I said, hey, how close you to providing more safety
[1186.52s - 1187.36s] for your children this year?
[1187.36s - 1189.16s] Cause he wanted them to move in with him.
[1189.16s - 1190.48s] He wanted to be able to provide for them
[1190.48s - 1191.76s] and to make sure that they were safe.
[1191.76s - 1194.12s] And so I think that if we just ask ourselves,
[1194.12s - 1197.24s] why do I truly want to accomplish this goal?
[1197.24s - 1198.32s] It kind of reveals itself
[1198.32s - 1199.96s] and it makes it a lot easier to take the action.
[1199.96s - 1200.88s] Yeah, for sure.
[1200.88s - 1203.24s] I mean, I, you know, and I appreciate all the kind words,
[1203.24s - 1204.84s] but I can definitely say the only thing
[1204.84s - 1206.40s] that's kept me going is my why
[1206.40s - 1208.66s] because I think there are so many things
[1208.66s - 1212.20s] that either make you want to give up or slow down
[1212.20s - 1214.64s] or become lazy or complacent.
[1214.64s - 1216.36s] And when I look at it and someone asked me this,
[1216.36s - 1220.32s] I was sitting with another creator end of last year
[1220.32s - 1221.52s] and he was just like to me,
[1221.52s - 1223.20s] Jay, why do you even do anything anymore?
[1223.20s - 1224.12s] Like what's the point?
[1224.12s - 1225.48s] Like it seems like you're good.
[1225.48s - 1227.16s] Like why do you need to do anything?
[1227.16s - 1230.52s] And I was like, we've just got to the start of everything.
[1230.52s - 1232.56s] Like I just got to the beginning of where I need to be.
[1232.56s - 1234.72s] I was like, we've just got to a point
[1234.72s - 1237.12s] where we can connect with lots of people,
[1237.12s - 1239.56s] but we need to give people the step by step process
[1239.56s - 1241.00s] to transform their life.
[1241.00s - 1243.00s] And now we can take them on the journey
[1243.00s - 1245.28s] because people are listening, they're engaged,
[1245.32s - 1248.48s] we have a community, we have a connection with people.
[1248.48s - 1250.72s] But when I started out, we didn't have any of that.
[1250.72s - 1253.36s] So I see it as we just got to the start
[1253.36s - 1255.04s] of where I want to be because,
[1255.04s - 1256.68s] and it was just interesting to me
[1256.68s - 1260.08s] that so many people struggle to find their why.
[1260.08s - 1263.48s] And I think it's because we don't,
[1263.48s - 1265.60s] no one's, and you just said your coach helped you do it.
[1265.60s - 1267.20s] It was the same with me, my art teacher
[1267.20s - 1271.60s] at from age 11 to age 18, he was my art teacher at school.
[1271.60s - 1274.04s] And every time I'd paint something or draw something
[1274.04s - 1276.64s] or do a collage or a graphic design,
[1276.64s - 1278.40s] and whatever I'd do, the first question he'd ask me
[1278.40s - 1280.04s] is why did you do it?
[1280.04s - 1282.60s] And I'd be like, because my initial response was
[1282.60s - 1284.32s] because it looks good, like, you know, I was a kid,
[1284.32s - 1285.16s] what do I know?
[1285.16s - 1286.76s] And he'd be like, every year he'd be like,
[1286.76s - 1287.60s] why did you do it?
[1287.60s - 1288.92s] And I'd be like, oh, because this color matches
[1288.92s - 1289.76s] with this color.
[1289.76s - 1291.00s] And then be like, why do you do it?
[1291.00s - 1294.00s] And I'm like, oh, because it reveals the metaphor
[1294.00s - 1295.04s] that I think this is about.
[1295.04s - 1296.12s] And then he'd be like, why did you do it?
[1296.12s - 1298.32s] And I'm like, because that's how I'm feeling right now.
[1298.32s - 1300.16s] I'm trying to, and every year he would ask me,
[1300.16s - 1303.60s] he would reveal more and more layers of my psyche
[1303.64s - 1305.24s] in a similar way.
[1305.24s - 1307.36s] And again, I've owed it to someone in my life
[1307.36s - 1310.92s] who pushed me to ask the question why, same as you.
[1310.92s - 1312.48s] And so I think what we're both saying is,
[1312.48s - 1314.20s] please ask that question to yourself.
[1314.20s - 1315.68s] But what if someone asked that question
[1315.68s - 1317.44s] and they feel stuck and they kind of go,
[1317.44s - 1319.24s] I've asked it, but it's kind of just like,
[1319.24s - 1320.20s] just want a nice house.
[1320.20s - 1322.00s] They could just want a nice car or just,
[1322.00s - 1323.76s] I just kind of want to, you know,
[1323.76s - 1325.12s] like it's not that deep.
[1325.12s - 1326.20s] And I think you're right.
[1326.20s - 1328.16s] Like you said, we don't have a lot of primal fears.
[1328.16s - 1329.80s] Like some people are listening right now,
[1329.80s - 1331.32s] we'll have fears of survival.
[1331.32s - 1333.40s] And that is driving them and they are working hard
[1333.40s - 1334.36s] and they are pushing.
[1334.36s - 1337.16s] And at the same time, we'll have people who like driven,
[1337.16s - 1338.52s] but they're like, I'm not driven enough
[1338.52s - 1341.12s] because I haven't got anything to be that scared about
[1341.12s - 1342.28s] or that worried about what,
[1342.28s - 1344.40s] how do that person discover their worth?
[1344.40s - 1347.08s] Yeah, I think for me, it's like,
[1347.08s - 1349.40s] my life was never terrible.
[1349.40s - 1351.56s] Or, you know, like when I started the,
[1351.56s - 1353.40s] yeah, when I started the podcast, The Mindset Mentor,
[1353.40s - 1355.20s] like I was at a point in my life
[1355.20s - 1357.40s] where I was making a whole bunch of money.
[1357.40s - 1360.60s] And I was 27 years old and I was making 250 grand a year
[1360.60s - 1363.16s] and I was working from home and everything was great.
[1363.16s - 1367.44s] But I felt like I was slowly withering away.
[1367.44s - 1370.40s] And I could see what the future was going to be
[1370.40s - 1371.52s] while I was there.
[1371.52s - 1374.28s] And I said, okay, if I do this for another five years
[1374.28s - 1376.32s] and I'm 32 years old and I'm still doing this
[1376.32s - 1379.76s] or I have my manager's job, is that gonna fulfill me?
[1379.76s - 1382.04s] And it actually gave me more anxiety
[1382.04s - 1384.52s] to think about having my manager's job.
[1384.52s - 1386.48s] And then I sat there and I thought, okay, well like,
[1386.48s - 1388.16s] I really wanna do this podcasting thing.
[1388.16s - 1389.28s] It seems to be going pretty well.
[1389.28s - 1391.52s] I wanna coach people, I wanna help people.
[1391.52s - 1393.96s] And I also at the same time was like starting
[1393.96s - 1396.08s] an Amazon business and trying to make money online
[1396.08s - 1396.92s] and do that.
[1396.92s - 1398.72s] And so I thought about it and I asked myself,
[1398.72s - 1401.32s] okay, if I fast forward five years from today,
[1401.32s - 1403.36s] do I wanna be the person that's in sales management
[1403.36s - 1405.32s] like I'm doing now and consulting?
[1405.32s - 1407.44s] Do I wanna be the guy that's selling stuff on Amazon
[1407.44s - 1410.60s] and incredible Amazon business person?
[1410.60s - 1412.24s] Or do I wanna be the guy that's coaching people
[1412.24s - 1413.84s] and helping people change their lives?
[1413.84s - 1416.48s] And the immediate answer was very clear,
[1416.48s - 1417.84s] coaching people and changing their lives.
[1417.84s - 1420.32s] And I was like, okay, well that feels like it's the path.
[1420.44s - 1423.44s] And then immediately comes up is all kinds of fear.
[1423.44s - 1424.80s] Cause I don't know what I'm doing.
[1424.80s - 1427.12s] Like back in the day, 2015, nobody made any money
[1427.12s - 1427.96s] in podcasts.
[1427.96s - 1429.56s] I didn't have any idea of how to grow a business,
[1429.56s - 1431.08s] any of that type of stuff.
[1431.08s - 1433.44s] But what was important to me was number one,
[1433.44s - 1435.52s] when I fast forwarded into the future,
[1435.52s - 1438.88s] the futures that I didn't want seemed way more painful
[1438.88s - 1442.20s] than trying the unknown and what could be
[1442.20s - 1443.40s] if I did take the path.
[1443.40s - 1445.52s] And so that became more of a fear,
[1445.52s - 1447.64s] like the fear of judgment, the fear of putting myself
[1447.64s - 1449.76s] out there, other people's opinions, it was there.
[1449.76s - 1450.96s] It's still there.
[1450.96s - 1452.20s] And I don't know if you ever get past it,
[1452.20s - 1453.44s] but you just kind of get more used to it.
[1453.44s - 1456.68s] But the fear of being in the exact same position,
[1456.68s - 1458.76s] working the same job, maybe making a little bit more money,
[1458.76s - 1463.76s] doing this for every day until the day I die was terrifying.
[1463.76s - 1466.00s] That was a fear.
[1466.00s - 1468.32s] And I was like, well, then this path of the unknown
[1468.32s - 1469.68s] isn't as scary.
[1469.68s - 1471.88s] And so I might as well take this path of the unknown
[1471.88s - 1473.88s] and I'll be fully transparent.
[1473.88s - 1478.44s] There was, I shared this on like one other time, I think,
[1478.52s - 1483.12s] there was a moment in 2015 where I started the podcast
[1483.12s - 1486.73s] in August of 2015, November of 2015,
[1486.73s - 1488.81s] I was feeling like a whole lot of fear.
[1488.81s - 1490.49s] And I was like, I might have to go back
[1490.49s - 1491.61s] and work for someone else again.
[1491.61s - 1493.69s] And it was just fear was so in my head.
[1493.69s - 1495.29s] And I was like, I gotta go back to making money.
[1495.29s - 1496.57s] I got a new house, I got a mortgage.
[1496.57s - 1497.57s] I don't know how I'm gonna do this.
[1497.57s - 1499.37s] I'm not making any money doing this.
[1499.37s - 1501.53s] My sister came out to me and I believe,
[1501.53s - 1503.61s] if you're silent, the messages are always there.
[1503.61s - 1505.25s] If you're looking, the message are always there.
[1505.25s - 1507.81s] My sister was at her house and she goes,
[1507.85s - 1510.13s] hey, have you ever seen this box of dad's stuff?
[1510.13s - 1510.97s] And I was like, no.
[1510.97s - 1512.93s] And she brought up, my father was an alcoholic.
[1512.93s - 1515.49s] He passed away when I was 15 from his alcoholism.
[1515.49s - 1518.33s] And she brought out this box and it was like his glasses,
[1518.33s - 1522.01s] it was a T-shirt of his, it was his watch.
[1522.01s - 1524.05s] And the other things were a bunch of letters.
[1524.05s - 1527.37s] My dad was in jail for a little while for multiple DUIs
[1527.37s - 1529.89s] and they put him in jail and he would write letters to us.
[1529.89s - 1534.89s] And he wrote a letter to my sister on her 19th birthday.
[1535.13s - 1537.41s] And I was reading this, you know, 2015.
[1537.41s - 1539.93s] So he would have wrote it in 1999.
[1539.93s - 1541.77s] And the very last line was,
[1541.77s - 1545.41s] I hope you live your life with courage, love and laughter.
[1545.41s - 1549.51s] And I read it and it was like the universe warped.
[1549.51s - 1553.97s] And I was like, oh, he wrote this for me.
[1553.97s - 1555.57s] Like there was a moment where I was like,
[1555.57s - 1557.31s] he wrote this to my sister,
[1557.31s - 1559.97s] but the universe is giving this message through my dad
[1559.97s - 1561.41s] because I need to hear this right now.
[1561.41s - 1562.61s] Because I'm in so much fear.
[1562.61s - 1564.29s] And the very first line is courage.
[1564.29s - 1565.81s] Live your life with courage, love and laughter.
[1565.85s - 1568.44s] And I was like, I got to commit.
[1568.44s - 1570.76s] Like this has to be the thing.
[1570.76s - 1571.80s] I've got to make a decision.
[1571.80s - 1573.52s] And when you look at the root word of decision,
[1573.52s - 1575.48s] it's decadere, which means to cut off.
[1575.48s - 1578.20s] I'm going to cut off all other options.
[1578.20s - 1579.40s] You know, I'd heard like Will Smith say,
[1579.40s - 1580.40s] there's no reason to have plan B
[1580.40s - 1581.44s] because of distraction from plan A.
[1581.44s - 1583.40s] Like it's got to be the thing.
[1583.40s - 1585.28s] And I was like, oh my God, I got to commit to this thing.
[1585.28s - 1586.64s] I can't have any more feelings of like,
[1586.64s - 1588.28s] I'm going to go back to work it for someone else.
[1588.28s - 1590.36s] Like this is my life path.
[1590.36s - 1592.60s] I'm either going to succeed it or I'm going to die trying.
[1592.60s - 1594.68s] And I was like, I don't know what to do.
[1594.68s - 1596.52s] I was like, I'm going to get this tattoo to my arm.
[1596.52s - 1598.20s] So I literally have, you live your life
[1598.20s - 1599.88s] with courage, love and laughter, tattoo to my arm.
[1599.88s - 1601.56s] My very first tattoo I ever got.
[1601.56s - 1603.80s] But it was like, for me, people always think like,
[1603.80s - 1605.40s] when you make a decision, the fear disappears.
[1605.40s - 1606.88s] Like I wish that I could do these things.
[1606.88s - 1608.64s] But it's like, it's always there,
[1608.64s - 1610.08s] but you've got to learn that like the fear
[1610.08s - 1611.60s] is always going to be there.
[1611.60s - 1615.00s] But my bigger fear is getting to end my life
[1615.00s - 1618.00s] and having not done this, having not tried to help people.
[1618.00s - 1621.92s] You know, like being in the room with my father
[1621.92s - 1624.04s] after he passed away when I was 15 years old
[1624.08s - 1625.52s] and realizing, because he was the first person
[1625.52s - 1627.44s] I ever met that passed away,
[1627.44s - 1631.12s] I'm going to be there one day and I saw it.
[1631.12s - 1633.88s] I was like, oh yeah, that's, I'm going to,
[1633.88s - 1636.68s] he was a dreamer and he was an amazing person,
[1636.68s - 1638.56s] but he didn't do what he wanted to do.
[1638.56s - 1640.36s] I am not going to live that life.
[1640.36s - 1642.84s] I'm going to create what I want to create.
[1642.84s - 1644.28s] And now I have all of the other fears
[1644.28s - 1646.04s] that everyone else has, but my biggest fear
[1646.04s - 1648.44s] is getting to end my life and not having tried
[1648.44s - 1650.08s] or not having at least gone for it.
[1650.08s - 1652.12s] Yeah, that's, I love hearing that.
[1652.16s - 1655.56s] And you've reminded me of a great speech
[1655.56s - 1657.96s] that Jim Carrey gave, finally enough.
[1657.96s - 1660.68s] And he talked about how his dad, I believe his dad,
[1660.68s - 1661.64s] and I could be getting this wrong,
[1661.64s - 1664.28s] but he said that his dad was an accountant
[1664.28s - 1666.32s] and he did that to be safe.
[1666.32s - 1669.04s] And he said that when he was young,
[1669.04s - 1672.60s] his dad got made redundant from his safe job.
[1672.60s - 1674.80s] Jim Carrey said that in life,
[1674.80s - 1676.60s] you are probably going to fail
[1676.60s - 1678.08s] at something you don't love.
[1678.08s - 1680.52s] So you might as well try something you do love.
[1680.52s - 1683.60s] Like this idea that I'm choosing the safe option
[1683.60s - 1685.60s] or I'm choosing something that my parents thought
[1685.60s - 1687.44s] my family wanted, or I'm choosing something
[1687.44s - 1691.52s] I think is secure, even that's unstable and uncertain.
[1691.52s - 1694.44s] And so the uncertainty that you pursue
[1694.44s - 1697.40s] actually is less fearful because you're on top of it.
[1697.40s - 1698.24s] You're aware.
[1698.24s - 1700.40s] And I think that's one of the biggest habits
[1700.40s - 1702.52s] that I think has changed my life
[1702.52s - 1706.44s] is that I stopped believing and accepting
[1706.44s - 1708.36s] that I would get to a place
[1708.36s - 1711.28s] where I no longer had to use my brain, right?
[1711.28s - 1714.72s] Like I think we all believe subconsciously somewhere
[1714.72s - 1718.60s] that there's a paycheck, there's a bank balance,
[1718.60s - 1723.60s] there's a home, there's a fashion, there's a partner.
[1724.12s - 1725.76s] That means from that point on,
[1725.76s - 1727.32s] I don't have to think about anything.
[1727.32s - 1728.16s] It's all good, everything's perfect.
[1728.16s - 1729.56s] Because it's all good.
[1729.56s - 1732.16s] And I'd say my best habit in life
[1732.16s - 1734.80s] is recognizing that that is the biggest myth
[1734.80s - 1737.68s] that we've been sold, and I just don't accept it.
[1737.68s - 1742.16s] And I'm okay that my life requires constant work ethic
[1742.16s - 1745.20s] and effort and awareness and being astute
[1745.20s - 1748.32s] and being conscious because that is what's actually
[1748.32s - 1749.56s] being demanded by this world.
[1749.56s - 1754.44s] A uncertain world forces you to be conscious.
[1754.44s - 1757.88s] But if you're unconscious in an uncertain world,
[1757.88s - 1761.00s] that's leading to a really dangerous place.
[1761.00s - 1762.92s] And but I think we're waiting for that moment
[1762.92s - 1764.28s] where we can just not be conscious
[1764.28s - 1765.68s] because it's so much hard work.
[1765.68s - 1769.32s] But to your point, it's way harder work being unconscious
[1769.32s - 1772.20s] because the amount of unconscious issues that arise
[1772.20s - 1774.00s] are numerous.
[1774.00s - 1776.72s] I think there's like a lot of wisdom in what you said
[1776.72s - 1779.76s] because a lot of people would rather just be like,
[1779.76s - 1781.16s] well, let me get to this destination
[1781.16s - 1782.44s] once I'm there, everything becomes better.
[1782.44s - 1783.36s] Hey, I want that too.
[1783.36s - 1785.44s] I do too, right?
[1785.44s - 1787.24s] And I thought that for a long time.
[1787.24s - 1789.92s] And it's interesting that the journey that I've had is,
[1789.92s - 1793.16s] you know, I always wanted to make money
[1793.16s - 1795.08s] because I thought money was gonna give me
[1795.12s - 1795.96s] what I needed.
[1795.96s - 1797.12s] It would give me that safety and security
[1797.12s - 1799.04s] that I never felt as a child.
[1799.04s - 1801.76s] And then I got to a goal that I wanted to get to
[1801.76s - 1804.16s] and I realized I feel exactly the same
[1804.16s - 1805.16s] as I've always felt.
[1805.16s - 1806.16s] I don't feel any different.
[1806.16s - 1807.20s] I don't feel any more secure.
[1807.20s - 1808.04s] I don't feel any happier.
[1808.04s - 1809.80s] I don't feel any more loved.
[1809.80s - 1812.68s] And what I realized was I thought that the achievement,
[1812.68s - 1814.44s] the recognition from other people,
[1814.44s - 1815.56s] the money in my bank account,
[1815.56s - 1817.72s] the buying cool stuff would fill,
[1817.72s - 1820.84s] what I actually thought was and consciously now know
[1820.84s - 1822.28s] is I thought that all of those things
[1822.28s - 1824.28s] would fill a void that was inside of me.
[1824.28s - 1826.28s] And what I realized is what I was searching for
[1826.28s - 1828.40s] from the external world is actually what I was searching
[1828.40s - 1829.60s] for for myself.
[1829.60s - 1831.60s] And so the reason why I spend so much time
[1831.60s - 1833.68s] in silence nowadays, I'll just go out of my porch
[1833.68s - 1835.52s] and I'll just sit there for a couple of hours
[1835.52s - 1839.68s] is because I'm trying to fill the void
[1839.68s - 1843.24s] that I have created through life and through patterns
[1843.24s - 1846.52s] and through heartbreaks and through all of the things
[1846.52s - 1847.60s] that happened in my childhood.
[1847.60s - 1852.20s] And I'm trying to be there as the 38 year old man
[1852.24s - 1855.24s] for the nine year old boy that's still healing.
[1855.24s - 1858.28s] And what I've realized is that none of the material things,
[1858.28s - 1860.24s] anything externally will ever give me
[1860.24s - 1861.76s] what I was ever searching for.
[1861.76s - 1863.80s] Everything I've always searched for in the external
[1863.80s - 1865.76s] was what I've been searching for for myself.
[1865.76s - 1867.52s] And so I don't, I 100% agree with you.
[1867.52s - 1869.36s] I don't think there's any destination we ever get to.
[1869.36s - 1872.40s] I think I'm constantly going to overcome more things
[1872.40s - 1873.24s] every single day.
[1873.24s - 1875.32s] And you know, if I lived to 100,
[1875.32s - 1878.24s] I would be so lucky and it's another 62 more years.
[1878.24s - 1880.16s] I don't expect that I'm gonna get to the end of my life
[1880.20s - 1882.32s] and be like, I figured it out.
[1882.32s - 1884.08s] I think the beautiful thing part about is
[1884.08s - 1887.32s] I think that I was given this need for achievement
[1887.32s - 1889.60s] to realize that it doesn't change anything
[1889.60s - 1894.08s] because the path of wanting to achieve
[1894.08s - 1895.36s] and doing it through business
[1895.36s - 1897.44s] and doing it through growing and all that stuff
[1897.44s - 1902.44s] has actually lit up inside of me a spiritual journey
[1903.48s - 1904.60s] that wouldn't have been there
[1904.60s - 1906.68s] had I not wanted to go for those things.
[1906.68s - 1907.80s] Yeah, absolutely.
[1907.92s - 1912.20s] I heard this, you reminded me of this story
[1912.20s - 1914.36s] that's told about Benjamin Franklin
[1914.36s - 1917.56s] and Benjamin Franklin had 13 virtues.
[1917.56s - 1920.92s] And these were all qualities that he aspired to
[1920.92s - 1923.84s] develop in his life, simplicity, authenticity,
[1923.84s - 1925.84s] patience, things like that.
[1925.84s - 1927.80s] And when he was on his deathbed,
[1927.80s - 1930.64s] they asked him which one he didn't accomplish.
[1930.64s - 1932.52s] And he said it was the 13th one.
[1932.52s - 1933.60s] And they said, what was that?
[1933.60s - 1935.28s] And he said humility.
[1935.28s - 1938.36s] And I love that because I think what you're saying is
[1938.36s - 1941.56s] humility doesn't mean you're meek or weak.
[1941.56s - 1945.32s] It means I'm able to accept there's always more to learn.
[1945.32s - 1947.20s] I don't know everything.
[1947.20s - 1948.44s] And it's okay.
[1948.44s - 1950.64s] I'm gonna give myself grace for it too.
[1950.64s - 1953.68s] It isn't a feeling of I'm useless because I don't know.
[1953.68s - 1956.68s] It's actually I'll become more useful if I recognize
[1956.68s - 1959.00s] there are things that I still have to learn.
[1959.00s - 1961.84s] And when I'm listening to you about your spiritual journey
[1961.84s - 1964.08s] and that silence, I'm intrigued by that,
[1964.12s - 1973.04s] walk us through how you fill that void almost practice wise.
[1973.04s - 1974.92s] Because I identify with that fully.
[1974.92s - 1976.16s] And it's funny because we always talked about
[1976.16s - 1977.92s] how our lives were kind of opposite.
[1977.92s - 1978.76s] Because when I met you,
[1978.76s - 1981.44s] I'd kind of gone down this deep spiritual path,
[1981.44s - 1984.00s] but I had no money and you were in the other boat
[1984.00s - 1987.08s] where you had sustained yourself financially
[1987.08s - 1989.44s] and create a really good stable place for yourself
[1989.44s - 1990.68s] where you were seeking spirituality.
[1990.68s - 1992.32s] And so we're kind of at, right?
[1992.32s - 1993.64s] We had that conversation.
[1994.20s - 1995.24s] And let's talk about that too.
[1995.24s - 1997.44s] But I'm intrigued as to how does that couple of hours
[1997.44s - 1998.72s] or whatever that time on your porch,
[1998.72s - 2000.84s] like how do you do that for people?
[2000.84s - 2003.48s] Because I think we like the sound of that,
[2003.48s - 2005.92s] but then we get distracted by the next thing.
[2005.92s - 2008.08s] What I've come to find and I can speak with them myself
[2008.08s - 2009.88s] and just what I've seen from other people.
[2009.88s - 2012.40s] But what I've seen with them myself is that
[2012.40s - 2015.24s] I've learned a lot of lessons from my dad.
[2015.24s - 2018.80s] Most of them after his death and me processing things.
[2018.80s - 2022.32s] My father was the way that he was and he became an alcoholic
[2022.32s - 2024.08s] because he had things in his past
[2024.08s - 2026.24s] that he hadn't worked through.
[2026.24s - 2028.76s] And the thing that he hadn't worked through
[2028.76s - 2031.68s] is when he was 12 years old, my father heard a gunshot.
[2031.68s - 2034.36s] He walked into the room and his dad had just shot himself
[2034.36s - 2035.76s] in the mouth of the shotgun.
[2035.76s - 2038.32s] And so my dad grew up in rural Tennessee.
[2038.32s - 2041.04s] This is 1960s when this happened.
[2041.04s - 2043.00s] Yeah, 1960s when this happened.
[2043.00s - 2044.92s] There wasn't a whole lot for him to understand.
[2044.92s - 2045.92s] There weren't podcasts.
[2045.92s - 2048.92s] There weren't books to read like we have nowadays.
[2048.92s - 2052.17s] And so I always consciously knew
[2052.17s - 2056.41s] that what was happening was that he had not healed his pain.
[2056.41s - 2058.61s] And Gabor Maté says, don't ask why the trauma,
[2058.61s - 2059.93s] ask why the pain.
[2059.93s - 2061.89s] And when I first heard Gabor Maté, I was like,
[2061.89s - 2063.53s] oh my God, someone's finally saying
[2063.53s - 2066.05s] what I always thought with my father.
[2066.05s - 2067.93s] And so, you know, we can look at him and say,
[2067.93s - 2070.65s] oh yeah, he's an alcoholic and he didn't overcome his trauma.
[2070.65s - 2072.85s] The trauma, the way it came up in my life
[2072.85s - 2074.41s] is I became a workaholic.
[2074.41s - 2077.41s] And so I didn't, you know, sometimes we could see someone
[2077.45s - 2079.53s] and say, oh, they drink too much alcohol.
[2079.53s - 2080.37s] They do too much drugs.
[2080.37s - 2081.57s] They eat too much food.
[2081.57s - 2085.93s] And we can say, oh yeah, that's their addiction.
[2085.93s - 2087.85s] The problem and the hard thing in our society
[2087.85s - 2092.33s] is that my addiction of workaholic is rewarded.
[2092.33s - 2093.53s] And people look up to it and they're like,
[2093.53s - 2094.37s] you're doing so great.
[2094.37s - 2095.21s] You're making so much money.
[2095.21s - 2096.69s] All of this is so good.
[2096.69s - 2100.01s] And what I came to find is that my workaholism
[2100.01s - 2103.73s] was just basically me trying to not feel my feelings
[2103.77s - 2106.69s] and to not work through and process those things.
[2107.49s - 2109.69s] You know, like scrolling on social media
[2109.69s - 2110.65s] could be that way for somebody.
[2110.65s - 2113.65s] It could be, some people are addicted to working out.
[2113.65s - 2115.93s] Some people are addicted to, you know, watching TV.
[2115.93s - 2118.01s] And there's so many, some people addicted to shopping.
[2118.01s - 2120.29s] There's so many different addictions that we have.
[2120.29s - 2123.93s] And what I found is that the hardest thing for me
[2123.93s - 2127.96s] was to stop and to just not have to,
[2127.96s - 2130.20s] I was always trying to fill every single moment of my day,
[2130.20s - 2131.70s] always try to be so busy.
[2131.70s - 2132.72s] When I didn't have something to do,
[2132.72s - 2134.92s] I'd find something to do with my business.
[2134.92s - 2137.48s] Businesses, you can always work all day, every day.
[2137.48s - 2138.64s] And so what I've tried to do
[2138.64s - 2141.36s] and I've built in my business is a lot of systems
[2141.36s - 2143.92s] and processes through my VP of operations
[2143.92s - 2145.96s] has really helped me with this a ton
[2145.96s - 2147.88s] to be able to take a lot of stuff off my plate
[2147.88s - 2150.80s] so that I have more time to just be.
[2150.80s - 2153.40s] It's my personal belief that I think
[2153.40s - 2155.48s] that God, the universe, life, whatever it is
[2155.48s - 2157.16s] speaks in silence.
[2157.16s - 2159.20s] And so if I want those messages, I need to be silent.
[2159.20s - 2161.88s] What I found for myself is when I would be silent,
[2161.92s - 2163.60s] a lot of anxiety would come up.
[2163.60s - 2164.80s] And I'd be like, you gotta go to the next thing.
[2164.80s - 2165.80s] You gotta go to the next thing.
[2165.80s - 2168.16s] This is stupid, you should be doing something else.
[2168.16s - 2170.12s] And then I just realized that what I was trying to do
[2170.12s - 2173.33s] is achieve to fill a void, but I could sit here.
[2173.33s - 2176.73s] And there's been moments where I'll sit on my porch
[2176.73s - 2179.29s] and I'll literally just start crying.
[2179.29s - 2181.57s] And I'm like, sometimes it's gratitude.
[2181.57s - 2183.33s] Oh my God, I can't believe I've been given this life.
[2183.33s - 2184.73s] I can't believe I've had these challenges.
[2184.73s - 2186.81s] I can't believe that I've had this come up.
[2186.81s - 2189.17s] I'm so grateful for every single aspect of it.
[2189.17s - 2190.77s] And sometimes I just sit there and tear it up
[2190.81s - 2193.01s] and I'm like, I don't know what this is,
[2193.01s - 2195.37s] but this is something my body's releasing.
[2195.37s - 2197.93s] And I need to be okay with this releasing process.
[2198.69s - 2200.21s] You know, there's a really interesting thing
[2200.21s - 2201.21s] that people can look at.
[2201.21s - 2204.77s] There's two videos that are really interesting on YouTube.
[2204.77s - 2207.17s] One of them is called Polar Bear Trauma,
[2207.17s - 2208.73s] where they show a video of a polar there
[2208.73s - 2210.57s] and they shoot it with a tranquilizer gun
[2210.57s - 2212.09s] from a helicopter.
[2212.09s - 2213.49s] They chase it down the helicopter,
[2213.49s - 2214.57s] really hide an experience.
[2214.57s - 2215.65s] They shoot it with a tranquilizer gun,
[2215.65s - 2219.01s] so it's still awake, but it's not completely out.
[2219.01s - 2220.29s] And it starts having a convulsion,
[2220.29s - 2221.61s] it starts seizureing.
[2221.61s - 2223.65s] And eventually after it's seizures,
[2223.65s - 2225.93s] what it's doing is it's releasing all of the cortisol,
[2225.93s - 2227.69s] all of the adrenaline from its body
[2227.69s - 2230.17s] so that there's no trauma that comes with it.
[2230.17s - 2233.93s] And so then it goes, after it's shaken for a while,
[2233.93s - 2236.81s] takes a really deep breath and it just kind of calms down.
[2236.81s - 2239.65s] Almost identical video of a impala
[2239.65s - 2241.01s] that gets attacked by a jaguar
[2241.01s - 2242.61s] and the jaguar gets scared off.
[2242.61s - 2245.61s] It starts to convulse, takes a deep breath,
[2245.61s - 2246.69s] and then it moves it.
[2246.69s - 2250.09s] And we're taught in our lives at some point in time
[2250.13s - 2252.89s] not to remove this and to work through these traumas
[2252.89s - 2255.17s] and these feelings, I think children naturally do it
[2255.17s - 2256.81s] through like temper tantrums, they move it.
[2256.81s - 2258.49s] And sometimes as adults,
[2258.49s - 2260.49s] we either need to have like an adult temper tantrum
[2260.49s - 2263.01s] in safety where you just take a pillow
[2263.01s - 2264.69s] and you can be angry, you can be mad,
[2264.69s - 2266.61s] you can just scream, you can cuss,
[2266.61s - 2268.65s] you can smash it against the bed,
[2268.65s - 2270.21s] whatever it is in safety,
[2270.21s - 2271.65s] buy yourself without other people around
[2271.65s - 2273.05s] so you don't scare them as well.
[2273.05s - 2275.53s] And then sometimes it's also just like sitting there
[2275.53s - 2278.93s] in silence and realizing that what is coming is going.
[2278.97s - 2280.01s] It's like when you squeeze an orange,
[2280.01s - 2281.09s] what's inside of it, orange juice,
[2281.09s - 2282.45s] because that's what's in it, right?
[2282.45s - 2284.01s] When you sit there and you put pressure on yourself
[2284.01s - 2285.33s] or you give yourself space,
[2285.33s - 2287.37s] what's coming out is actually what's inside
[2287.37s - 2289.53s] and your body's natural intelligence
[2289.53s - 2291.01s] is trying to let go of it.
[2291.01s - 2292.17s] And so for me, that's what I found
[2292.17s - 2293.97s] is that there's some moments where I'm just like,
[2293.97s - 2296.69s] incredibly grateful, there's some moments where I,
[2296.69s - 2299.89s] by doing nothing, Jay, I get so much anxiety
[2299.89s - 2300.97s] and I'm like, what is this?
[2300.97s - 2304.49s] Why, and instead of running from it, I get curious.
[2304.49s - 2307.33s] And I think if we could just get more curious,
[2307.33s - 2310.25s] like I've been reading a whole lot of Krishna Murthy recently,
[2310.25s - 2312.21s] I love Krishna Murthy.
[2312.21s - 2315.13s] And one thing he says is don't know yourself
[2315.13s - 2316.49s] because knowing is based in the past
[2316.49s - 2318.49s] and past is based off of memories.
[2318.49s - 2320.81s] Start learning yourself, which is in the present moment.
[2320.81s - 2323.17s] So be present and be like, what comes up?
[2323.17s - 2325.33s] How can I be curious about this anxious feeling
[2325.33s - 2326.65s] or these tears or whatever it is?
[2326.65s - 2330.17s] And just be in the space to just know yourself,
[2330.17s - 2332.13s] or get to know yourself a little bit better.
[2332.13s - 2333.09s] Yeah, it's so great.
[2333.09s - 2334.05s] I mean, talking about that,
[2335.21s - 2337.17s] goes to me back to what we were talking about
[2337.17s - 2338.01s] at the start of it.
[2338.01s - 2341.49s] You were saying how this idea of,
[2341.49s - 2342.77s] well, what if the worst thing happens?
[2342.77s - 2343.89s] What if the best thing happens?
[2343.89s - 2345.25s] And we're talking about this idea of Jim Carrey
[2345.25s - 2347.73s] and you were saying that there's this experience
[2347.73s - 2350.61s] of, well, I lost who Jim Carrey was.
[2350.61s - 2354.45s] And what we've both talked about is we are so much
[2354.45s - 2356.01s] of what our thoughts are.
[2356.01s - 2357.77s] And therefore, if you change the thoughts completely,
[2357.77s - 2359.69s] you're almost a completely different human.
[2359.69s - 2361.65s] So then who are we?
[2361.65s - 2364.33s] Comes back to this know thyself versus learning of thyself,
[2364.33s - 2367.65s] like what has that spiritual journey taken you on
[2367.65s - 2369.13s] to understanding identity?
[2370.20s - 2372.76s] I mean, God, Jay, that's like as deep as it could go.
[2374.12s - 2378.96s] That I'm just, I am just a soul that chose this life.
[2378.96s - 2380.80s] And one of the things that I like to do
[2380.80s - 2382.72s] is I like to think that I chose this life.
[2382.72s - 2387.72s] And that immediately takes me from being a victim in my life.
[2388.80s - 2390.92s] Oh, what was me, my father was this way,
[2390.92s - 2392.96s] he did this to me, my mom did this to me,
[2392.96s - 2396.20s] and my teachers acted this way versus me going like,
[2396.20s - 2398.84s] I think my soul chose this life
[2398.84s - 2402.48s] because this is whatever is needed for this path
[2402.48s - 2404.96s] that it's on for, you know, whether it's reincarnation
[2404.96s - 2406.00s] or whether it's heaven or hell
[2406.00s - 2407.22s] or whatever it comes after this.
[2407.22s - 2409.04s] I don't know, but I do know like right now
[2409.04s - 2411.52s] I do have this life as Rob dial.
[2411.52s - 2413.56s] And as I get older, the thing I realize
[2413.56s - 2415.28s] is that my body changes.
[2415.28s - 2417.16s] I'm not as fast as I used to be.
[2417.16s - 2418.68s] I'm a lot more sore than I used to be.
[2418.68s - 2421.44s] Like my body's changing, but my soul is this thing
[2421.44s - 2423.84s] that is just always there.
[2423.84s - 2425.84s] And so the thing that I've come to realize
[2425.84s - 2429.37s] is that I want to, I don't know if it's gonna sound weird,
[2429.37s - 2432.77s] like I want to unattach myself from this body,
[2432.77s - 2434.17s] from everything around me,
[2434.17s - 2435.65s] and I wanna try to connect back
[2435.65s - 2437.93s] to what's internally inside of me.
[2437.93s - 2441.53s] And the one thing that I find is that that never changes.
[2441.53s - 2445.21s] Like that, there's like a truth that's behind that.
[2445.21s - 2447.47s] And truth is the thing that never changes.
[2447.47s - 2448.31s] If something changes
[2448.31s - 2450.53s] or if something could be a question, that's not true.
[2450.61s - 2452.89s] But there's this feeling that feels like truth
[2452.89s - 2455.89s] inside of me at least and everybody has their own truth.
[2455.89s - 2457.81s] But for me, my truth is there's something
[2457.81s - 2459.81s] that's behind all of it.
[2459.81s - 2461.69s] And the more that I connect to it,
[2461.69s - 2463.49s] the more peace that I have.
[2463.49s - 2465.65s] Like I listened to a lot of Ram Dass
[2465.65s - 2467.37s] and one of the things that he said,
[2467.37s - 2469.29s] I was listening to him on the drive over here
[2469.29s - 2471.53s] and I listened to his meditation every day,
[2471.53s - 2473.97s] is the only work that you have to do
[2473.97s - 2476.25s] is the connection to your own heart.
[2477.29s - 2478.93s] And so I'm always constantly thinking,
[2478.93s - 2480.85s] what's in the way of my own heart?
[2480.85s - 2482.89s] What material possessions?
[2482.89s - 2485.95s] What things that I want to get her in the way of that?
[2485.95s - 2487.53s] And the reason why I think that it helps is number one,
[2487.53s - 2492.53s] I've had so much more peace from trying to connect to that.
[2492.81s - 2495.89s] And my relationship with my wife has been so much better
[2495.89s - 2496.73s] because of it,
[2496.73s - 2499.09s] because I'm not blocking her from letting her in.
[2499.09s - 2501.17s] She's experiencing me fully.
[2501.17s - 2504.53s] She starts to be able to open up even more
[2504.53s - 2505.37s] in different ways.
[2505.37s - 2507.45s] I'd be able to experience her more fully.
[2507.45s - 2508.29s] And so for me,
[2508.29s - 2510.57s] it's just like connecting to the thing that's behind it
[2510.57s - 2512.17s] that feels like the only thing that's truth.
[2512.17s - 2516.33s] Now, mind you, if Rob, 15 years ago had heard this,
[2516.33s - 2518.21s] he would be like, what the hell is that guy talking about?
[2518.21s - 2519.77s] It would make no sense.
[2519.77s - 2520.65s] But on this journey,
[2520.65s - 2524.45s] I've just kind of realized that there's something behind it all
[2524.45s - 2526.37s] and I want to try to connect to that something behind it all
[2526.37s - 2527.21s] and see what it is.
[2527.21s - 2530.61s] And so for me, it's like I like to use myself as a guinea pig.
[2530.61s - 2533.05s] Everything I teach in the mindset mentor and the podcast
[2533.05s - 2534.93s] is all stuff that I'm trying within myself.
[2534.93s - 2537.49s] And I use it as almost my own therapy sessions
[2537.49s - 2538.57s] where I'm talking to everybody,
[2538.57s - 2539.77s] but I'm talking to myself.
[2539.77s - 2541.65s] I'm reminding myself of all these things.
[2541.65s - 2544.45s] And what I realized is I realized
[2544.45s - 2547.97s] that after 15, 19 years of personal development,
[2547.97s - 2549.29s] it's like, you know,
[2549.29s - 2551.33s] personal development is like this cup right here.
[2551.33s - 2553.89s] And I feel like my cup in personal development was overflowing.
[2553.89s - 2556.25s] And then I found spiritual development
[2556.25s - 2558.93s] and I realized, oh my God, it's a lot bigger cup.
[2558.93s - 2560.61s] And it's not even close to being full.
[2560.61s - 2562.05s] Like it's a bucket and it needs,
[2562.05s - 2564.17s] it's my next thing that I'm working on.
[2564.17s - 2566.61s] So for me, it's like the mindset that working through,
[2566.61s - 2568.77s] like I'm constantly working on this and trying to get better.
[2568.77s - 2570.61s] But for me, it's like, I want to connect to myself
[2570.61s - 2572.41s] and see what else is in there.
[2572.41s - 2573.25s] Yeah, for sure.
[2573.25s - 2574.09s] Thank you for sharing that.
[2574.09s - 2579.09s] I mean, you made me remember a CS Lewis statement
[2579.37s - 2581.37s] that says you don't have a soul,
[2581.37s - 2583.93s] you are the soul and you have a body.
[2583.93s - 2586.09s] And I remember I used to have that written
[2586.09s - 2588.77s] on a little post-it note and I used to look at it
[2588.77s - 2590.85s] every day, first thing in the morning.
[2590.85s - 2593.49s] Because I was thinking about this concept of identity
[2593.49s - 2596.85s] that the first thing 99% of us do
[2596.85s - 2598.69s] when we wake up first thing in the morning
[2598.69s - 2600.37s] is we look in the mirror.
[2600.37s - 2603.93s] Usually we say something like, oh, I look tired
[2603.93s - 2608.17s] or don't like that spot or God, I put on weight,
[2608.17s - 2609.61s] God, whatever it is, right?
[2609.61s - 2611.05s] Now all of a sudden we're already
[2611.05s - 2615.05s] in the bodily concept of life, this bodily consciousness.
[2615.05s - 2618.57s] And now you live your whole day thinking about the body.
[2618.57s - 2619.53s] What does the body need?
[2619.53s - 2621.53s] The body needs food, et cetera.
[2621.93s - 2625.57s] And that's natural, that's not unnatural, that's normal.
[2625.57s - 2627.37s] I do that too.
[2627.37s - 2629.25s] But then you're saying that at the same time
[2629.25s - 2631.81s] you've got to nurture and nourish
[2631.81s - 2634.77s] and connect with this deeper sense.
[2634.77s - 2637.21s] How do you balance the two in a real world
[2637.21s - 2639.45s] where you have responsibilities, you have bills,
[2639.45s - 2642.81s] you have things to do that are connected to the body.
[2642.81s - 2643.97s] But then at the same time we're like,
[2643.97s - 2644.89s] but you're not this body.
[2644.89s - 2646.09s] So how do you balance?
[2646.09s - 2648.29s] How do you make sense of these two
[2648.29s - 2649.85s] seemingly opposite pursuits?
[2649.85s - 2652.73s] Yeah, I mean, the thing that I think
[2652.73s - 2654.49s] I would have thought five or 10 years ago
[2654.49s - 2657.41s] was that the more that I get into spiritual development,
[2657.41s - 2659.33s] the less motivated I'll become of the most,
[2659.33s - 2661.37s] the less I will want to achieve.
[2661.37s - 2664.13s] That hasn't gone away in any sort of way.
[2664.13s - 2667.37s] But what I have found is that I achieve
[2667.37s - 2672.60s] through a place of, it's more like,
[2672.68s - 2675.28s] I'm not white knuckling my way through life anymore.
[2675.28s - 2678.00s] I can take action and not be so wrapped up
[2678.00s - 2680.40s] in my fears and my limiting beliefs.
[2680.40s - 2683.16s] And so it's not like I'm in the world
[2683.16s - 2684.52s] and of the world at the same time
[2684.52s - 2686.16s] where it's like the soul is here
[2686.16s - 2689.20s] and as I'm speaking to everything that I say
[2689.20s - 2691.12s] is also something that I struggle with every single day.
[2691.12s - 2693.32s] I have not mastered this process.
[2693.32s - 2697.04s] There'll be times where I find myself just so in the world.
[2697.04s - 2699.08s] And I'm just like stressed, there's things happening,
[2699.08s - 2701.08s] there's this business where there's all of this,
[2701.08s - 2702.32s] we've got employees, we're hiring people,
[2702.32s - 2704.12s] there's stuff happening.
[2704.12s - 2707.22s] And then I just take a step back and I'm like,
[2707.70s - 2709.66s] it's just like a kind of like a game.
[2709.66s - 2712.34s] Take a second, it's all real.
[2712.34s - 2714.78s] I'm not saying it's not true, it's not reality,
[2714.78s - 2717.14s] it's not in front of you, it's all there.
[2717.14s - 2720.50s] But behind it all, if I can connect to a deeper sense
[2720.50s - 2724.50s] that's within me and the soul that I feel is in there,
[2724.50s - 2727.27s] I'm like, hey man, chill out for a second.
[2727.27s - 2729.67s] It's really not that big of a deal.
[2729.67s - 2731.91s] Most things, there are definitely some things
[2731.91s - 2733.79s] that are big deals in people's lives and there's deaths
[2733.79s - 2737.95s] and there's things that people have to be in control of
[2737.95s - 2739.79s] and be able to pay bills and all that stuff.
[2739.79s - 2742.11s] All of those are real and they're definitely necessary.
[2742.11s - 2745.12s] But behind it all, you're still there.
[2745.12s - 2749.12s] And there's this thing that if I can take myself back
[2749.12s - 2750.68s] and kind of like out of my own head
[2750.68s - 2753.60s] and kind of into my heart, which has been a big journey
[2753.60s - 2755.96s] for me because I'm so analytical
[2755.96s - 2758.00s] and was never really taught like feelings
[2758.00s - 2759.40s] and how to feel and process emotions.
[2759.40s - 2761.76s] But if I can take myself out of my head and into my heart,
[2761.76s - 2763.64s] what I've always found is that my head
[2763.64s - 2765.80s] is always projecting itself into the future
[2765.80s - 2767.64s] or sometimes projecting itself into the past.
[2767.64s - 2770.40s] But most for me, like if I sit down to meditate sometimes
[2770.40s - 2772.12s] it's like all of my to-do list,
[2772.12s - 2773.36s] all of the things that I have to do
[2773.36s - 2776.12s] and it's projecting itself into the future.
[2776.12s - 2778.20s] So my brain is always somewhere else.
[2778.20s - 2780.79s] My body, it's always here.
[2780.79s - 2782.19s] And so when I notice myself get stressed,
[2782.19s - 2784.35s] I notice myself get anxious, I notice myself,
[2784.35s - 2786.83s] whatever feelings that might be feeling.
[2786.83s - 2788.11s] If I can take a couple deep breaths
[2788.11s - 2790.07s] and kind of get back into my body,
[2790.07s - 2791.63s] I'm like, it's not that bad.
[2792.47s - 2795.87s] You have overcome so many things in your life.
[2795.87s - 2797.31s] You'll figure out a way to get through it.
[2797.31s - 2798.73s] And so what I've found is that it's not
[2798.73s - 2799.95s] that I don't take the action.
[2799.95s - 2803.79s] It's not that I'm not wanting to achieve more and more things
[2803.79s - 2805.55s] and be able to have more fun and have more,
[2805.55s - 2807.67s] do all of this stuff in the external world.
[2807.67s - 2810.03s] But when I find myself kind of take a step back
[2810.03s - 2811.67s] and kind of be in my heart,
[2811.67s - 2812.79s] is it makes it a lot easier
[2812.79s - 2814.15s] where I'm not like white knuckling
[2814.15s - 2815.75s] and forcing my way through life.
[2815.75s - 2819.67s] It's almost like I'm allowing life to happen through me.
[2819.71s - 2821.63s] And I don't know how it works.
[2821.63s - 2823.51s] And I don't pretend to be smart enough,
[2823.51s - 2826.27s] but things start happening around me
[2826.27s - 2829.87s] that help me in the process of getting to
[2829.87s - 2832.23s] wherever it is that I actually want to truly go.
[2832.23s - 2835.19s] Yeah, there's this really interesting thing
[2835.19s - 2836.63s] in Eastern traditions.
[2836.63s - 2840.07s] There's obviously this idea of oneness
[2840.07s - 2841.79s] and that everything's one.
[2841.79s - 2843.71s] And then there's this idea of duality
[2843.71s - 2847.67s] that there's this side and then there's this side.
[2847.67s - 2851.43s] And one teaching that I've really connected with
[2851.43s - 2856.43s] is this idea of simultaneously one and different.
[2856.55s - 2859.07s] And it sounds complex, but it's actually not.
[2859.07s - 2862.31s] It's this idea that this feels real
[2862.31s - 2863.99s] and it can be real and it is real.
[2863.99s - 2866.43s] And at the same time, there is a greater reality.
[2866.43s - 2867.95s] So rather than this feeling of everything's one,
[2867.95s - 2869.19s] everything's the same,
[2869.19s - 2872.27s] or it's disconnected, there's real and fake,
[2872.27s - 2874.67s] it's actually this idea that a lot of things are real,
[2874.67s - 2875.63s] but they're not the full picture.
[2875.63s - 2877.79s] So the idea that today in LA,
[2877.83s - 2880.99s] it's like saying the weather's rainy and cloudy,
[2880.99s - 2882.87s] but that's not the weather everywhere.
[2882.87s - 2884.43s] So it's my current reality,
[2884.43s - 2887.47s] but it's not reality across the whole world.
[2887.47s - 2890.19s] And when you start looking at life in that way
[2890.19s - 2893.71s] of there's this reality and then there's this bigger reality,
[2893.71s - 2895.23s] I think that's that zoom out.
[2895.23s - 2896.51s] That's that, let me take a breath.
[2896.51s - 2899.79s] That's that, let me look at the inner world as well.
[2899.79s - 2903.31s] And I think what it does is it gives you a certain grace
[2903.31s - 2906.67s] and it gives you a certain detachment, disconnection,
[2906.67s - 2911.63s] but also a recognition of the significance of what you do
[2911.63s - 2913.55s] and the insignificance of it.
[2913.55s - 2915.35s] And both are so needed.
[2915.35s - 2917.31s] I believe what I do is significant.
[2917.31s - 2920.07s] And at the same time, it's totally insignificant.
[2920.07s - 2921.63s] We won't be remembered in a thousand years.
[2921.63s - 2923.39s] And it's so okay.
[2923.39s - 2925.15s] And but we take it so seriously.
[2925.15s - 2926.59s] And if you only do one or the other,
[2926.59s - 2930.15s] like if I only see my life as extremely significant,
[2930.15s - 2931.75s] everything's too high pressure.
[2931.75s - 2935.23s] Oh my gosh, I would, it would hurt me.
[2935.23s - 2937.47s] And it would cause me pain if I thought everything I did
[2937.47s - 2939.51s] was of utmost significance.
[2939.51s - 2941.67s] And if I thought my life was insignificant,
[2941.67s - 2943.31s] if I thought my life was irrelevant,
[2943.31s - 2945.27s] that would be really bad for my self-esteem.
[2945.27s - 2947.47s] I wouldn't be able to function.
[2947.47s - 2949.55s] And so I think it's really interesting
[2949.55s - 2950.99s] because the more and more I'm learning,
[2950.99s - 2953.11s] I'm like, I have to learn how to hold
[2953.11s - 2954.87s] these two seemingly opposite things.
[2954.87s - 2957.79s] But actually they're so connected and symbiotic
[2957.79s - 2959.59s] and they're so synchronous
[2959.59s - 2962.67s] because they both have value going back to
[2962.71s - 2965.15s] which thought has value.
[2965.15s - 2968.47s] The collective thought of my life is significant
[2968.47s - 2971.15s] and insignificant is the most helpful thought.
[2971.15s - 2971.99s] Oh my God, that is so good.
[2971.99s - 2973.31s] Because thinking I'm significant and insignificant
[2973.31s - 2974.59s] are both unhelpful thoughts.
[2974.59s - 2977.27s] Oh my God, you actually just summarized perfectly
[2977.27s - 2979.59s] what I feel like actually has been going through my head
[2979.59s - 2984.59s] for years, which is what I do, I do believe is so important.
[2984.83s - 2988.03s] And at the same time, I'm like, none of it matters, right?
[2988.03s - 2989.75s] It's this weird duality that we live in.
[2989.75s - 2990.67s] It's so free.
[2990.67s - 2994.05s] But it's so free because it takes so much pressure off
[2994.05s - 2995.75s] where it just becomes like fun.
[2995.75s - 2998.99s] Like it's, how can I bring more fun into life?
[2998.99s - 3002.55s] Like when did we lose the joy of life
[3002.55s - 3004.11s] and the fun of life that we had as children?
[3004.11s - 3005.43s] When was it programmed out of us?
[3005.43s - 3007.15s] And how can I connect to that child
[3007.15s - 3009.15s] and bring that spirit back in and be like,
[3009.15s - 3011.87s] yeah, I'm going to do some amazing things in the world.
[3011.87s - 3013.75s] But without it being stressful,
[3013.75s - 3015.87s] just with it being fun and with it being something
[3015.87s - 3019.19s] that I can do and it effortlessly flows out of me.
[3019.31s - 3023.63s] I believe that every single person is incredibly creative
[3023.63s - 3028.11s] and we are creators at the actual core of us.
[3028.11s - 3031.07s] And a lot of us have lost it and I lost it for years.
[3031.07s - 3033.91s] And so what I think is how can I make the creativity
[3033.91s - 3036.23s] flow out of me in some sort of way
[3036.23s - 3038.67s] and just allow the space for it to happen.
[3038.67s - 3039.95s] And one of the things that happens
[3039.95s - 3043.11s] and it's not necessarily my goal of it,
[3043.11s - 3046.31s] but when I sit in silence, I get ideas that come through
[3046.31s - 3049.39s] and I'm like, oh man, I don't know how I didn't see this.
[3049.39s - 3050.55s] And that's where they all are.
[3050.55s - 3052.47s] So it's like, a lot of times we're trying to force things
[3052.47s - 3053.55s] to happen, we're trying to force creativity,
[3053.55s - 3054.91s] we're trying to force ideas,
[3054.91s - 3057.35s] but sometimes when I get there, I'm like, oh man,
[3057.35s - 3059.39s] yeah, this is the thing I've been searching for.
[3059.39s - 3061.63s] And it's just, I think every person just needs
[3061.63s - 3064.03s] to give themselves just a little bit more space
[3064.03s - 3066.95s] to not be on their phone, to not be constantly,
[3066.95s - 3068.59s] you know, and a lot of people have children,
[3068.59s - 3070.99s] their children are up, can you wake up a little bit earlier,
[3070.99s - 3073.51s] not be on your phone and just sit in silence
[3073.51s - 3074.51s] and see what comes up.
[3074.55s - 3076.67s] And I think that it's really important for people
[3076.67s - 3080.55s] because what you'll notice is exactly what you're saying,
[3080.55s - 3083.91s] which is what we do, like this life is so important,
[3083.91s - 3086.11s] but it is very insignificant and that's okay.
[3086.11s - 3087.15s] There's nothing wrong with that.
[3087.15s - 3089.31s] Like I love watching videos on YouTube
[3089.31s - 3091.11s] about how small the earth is compared
[3091.11s - 3092.59s] to the rest of the universe.
[3092.59s - 3093.85s] And it stresses my wife out.
[3093.85s - 3096.31s] She's like, I'm gonna have a panic attack.
[3096.31s - 3097.47s] Why do you watch this?
[3097.47s - 3100.03s] Because I was like, I like to remind myself
[3100.03s - 3102.47s] that even though it's all happening and I'm in it,
[3102.47s - 3104.47s] none of it actually truly matters.
[3104.47s - 3105.29s] And that's okay.
[3105.29s - 3106.13s] Absolutely.
[3106.13s - 3107.19s] And I think when I'm listening to you,
[3107.19s - 3110.31s] there's this feeling that, you know,
[3110.31s - 3112.07s] I feel like I agree with you.
[3112.07s - 3113.31s] I think everyone is a creator.
[3113.31s - 3116.67s] I do believe that creativity flows when we connect with that.
[3116.67s - 3119.75s] But I think sometimes we feel so distracted from it.
[3119.75s - 3121.75s] And it's so much easier to pull out our phone.
[3121.75s - 3124.19s] It's so much easier to put on a show in the background.
[3124.19s - 3126.43s] It's so much easier to do all of these.
[3126.43s - 3128.91s] It's so much easier to do all those things at the same time.
[3128.91s - 3132.27s] Like now we're no longer ever with one person.
[3132.31s - 3135.31s] We're with one person, we're both on our phones
[3135.31s - 3137.55s] and we're watching a show at the same time
[3137.55s - 3139.23s] and we've got our laptops doing work.
[3139.23s - 3142.19s] So you've literally got three screens in front of you,
[3142.19s - 3144.23s] five screens in total.
[3144.23s - 3147.23s] And there's so much distraction, right?
[3147.23s - 3148.63s] We know that.
[3148.63s - 3150.51s] How does a person possibly,
[3150.51s - 3152.35s] and I say this out of like compassion and empathy
[3152.35s - 3156.07s] because it's like, it requires so much from us.
[3156.07s - 3159.03s] Because everything around us is built for distraction.
[3159.03s - 3160.15s] The foods we're eating,
[3160.15s - 3162.35s] the things we drink and consume,
[3162.35s - 3165.95s] the stuff that's created around us, it's all to distract.
[3165.95s - 3168.35s] So you're fighting like almost what feels
[3168.35s - 3170.63s] to a lot of people like a losing battle.
[3170.63s - 3172.63s] What do you do to get pick yourself back up?
[3172.63s - 3176.31s] I mean, what's more important than that?
[3176.31s - 3177.75s] You know, like what's more important
[3177.75s - 3180.47s] than connecting to your true self, to working on yourself?
[3180.47s - 3184.59s] Like, why am I so hardcore on mindset?
[3184.59s - 3186.39s] Cause I know how many people are so wrapped up
[3186.39s - 3189.43s] in their mindset and their thoughts and their beliefs
[3189.43s - 3191.43s] and their patterns that they're stuck in.
[3191.43s - 3195.35s] And what ultimately we all want, I think is freedom.
[3195.35s - 3197.71s] And the way to get through to that freedom
[3197.71s - 3199.63s] is to work on yourself, whatever that looks like
[3199.63s - 3202.03s] for whatever stage someone is in, you know?
[3202.03s - 3206.43s] And I can have empathy for every person at every stage
[3206.43s - 3209.91s] cause I've been through so many stages of my process.
[3209.91s - 3213.63s] And I think that it comes back to like, why are you doing it?
[3213.63s - 3214.47s] What do you want?
[3214.47s - 3218.11s] If you're trying to disconnect from your phone, why?
[3218.11s - 3221.31s] You know, like for me, like I recently deleted Instagram
[3221.31s - 3222.19s] from my phone.
[3222.19s - 3225.35s] I did it last year for a month, felt like it was amazing.
[3225.35s - 3227.25s] The book came out and I was like, I gotta get back on.
[3227.25s - 3228.09s] I gotta promote.
[3228.09s - 3229.43s] I gotta make sure things are good.
[3229.43s - 3231.11s] I recently just deleted it again.
[3231.11s - 3232.99s] And now everything that I post,
[3232.99s - 3234.39s] everything flows through my team.
[3234.39s - 3235.71s] So it's not like it's just gone.
[3235.71s - 3237.99s] It's just now I just happen to flow
[3237.99s - 3240.55s] if everything flows through my team.
[3240.55s - 3241.59s] Why did I do that though?
[3241.59s - 3246.47s] Was because I don't want to live my life on that phone.
[3246.95s - 3248.55s] One thing that I noticed is that Instagram
[3248.55s - 3251.27s] was one of the things where I would pick it up
[3251.27s - 3253.91s] and I would just somehow get to it.
[3253.91s - 3256.55s] And I wasn't even thinking about getting to it.
[3256.55s - 3259.59s] And I was like, my life is not this little tiny thing.
[3259.59s - 3262.11s] My life is everything that's out here.
[3262.11s - 3264.95s] And so why did I delete it?
[3264.95s - 3267.87s] It was because I actually want to be in everything.
[3267.87s - 3269.87s] I want to be present with my wife.
[3269.87s - 3272.11s] When we have children, I want to be present with our children.
[3272.11s - 3274.67s] I want to be the most present version of myself
[3274.67s - 3275.51s] as I possibly can.
[3275.55s - 3278.59s] And I can't imagine that I'll get to the end of my life
[3278.59s - 3279.59s] be a hundred years old and be like,
[3279.59s - 3282.27s] I wish I would have spent more time on Instagram.
[3282.27s - 3284.95s] I wish I would have spent more time watching Netflix.
[3284.95s - 3287.99s] And I've been addicted to all of those things.
[3287.99s - 3291.19s] I'm not above any of this stuff.
[3291.19s - 3292.79s] But I started looking at myself and saying like,
[3292.79s - 3294.87s] is this helping me get to where I want to be in life?
[3294.87s - 3296.79s] Is it creating more peace in my life?
[3296.79s - 3298.27s] For me, it was creating way more stress.
[3298.27s - 3299.75s] So it was perpetuating these feelings
[3299.75s - 3302.43s] that I'm trying to let go of and trying to work with.
[3302.43s - 3304.31s] And so for me, I think what's important to people
[3304.31s - 3306.43s] is like, if you want to make a change,
[3306.43s - 3308.11s] why do you want to make the change?
[3308.11s - 3311.99s] And for me, looking at a screen is not as important
[3311.99s - 3314.51s] as actually physically being in front of my wife
[3314.51s - 3316.59s] and giving her what she actually truly deserves.
[3316.59s - 3319.15s] It's just a hundred percent of my attention.
[3319.15s - 3319.99s] Because there's been times
[3319.99s - 3322.23s] where I've not given her a hundred percent of my attention.
[3322.23s - 3325.07s] And as we start to have kids and stuff,
[3325.07s - 3327.51s] I don't want to be a distracted parent.
[3327.51s - 3328.79s] I want to be with them.
[3328.79s - 3330.23s] I'll never sit there and go,
[3330.23s - 3332.47s] well, when my kids were kids, my kids were children.
[3332.47s - 3334.19s] Like, I wish I would have spent more time on Instagram.
[3334.19s - 3337.39s] I wish I would have spent more time watching Netflix.
[3337.39s - 3340.19s] I just think for me, like the level of,
[3340.19s - 3341.47s] the place I met in my life
[3341.47s - 3343.39s] is I want to be as present as possible
[3343.39s - 3345.67s] because I've worked for things.
[3345.67s - 3347.47s] I've climbed ladders, I've gotten to different places.
[3347.47s - 3349.07s] I've realized none of those things
[3349.07s - 3350.83s] fulfilled me in any sort of way.
[3350.83s - 3353.47s] And this journey I've been on in the past, you know,
[3353.47s - 3354.87s] 10 years, seven years ago,
[3354.87s - 3356.91s] and we started talking about the Bhagavad Gita.
[3356.91s - 3359.03s] And I started meditating a whole lot more
[3359.03s - 3360.39s] and getting into it as I realized,
[3360.39s - 3362.59s] oh, these things are bringing me peace.
[3362.75s - 3364.63s] And the more peaceful I feel,
[3364.63s - 3367.31s] the more that it becomes easy to actually achieve
[3367.31s - 3368.75s] and create the stuff that I want to in life.
[3368.75s - 3372.03s] And so for me, the presence in the peace
[3372.03s - 3373.75s] at this point in my life, things might change.
[3373.75s - 3375.35s] I don't know what it's going to be in five years,
[3375.35s - 3377.35s] are actually the things that are the most important to me.
[3377.35s - 3378.23s] Yeah, it's so interesting.
[3378.23s - 3381.67s] I think we feel like being anxious and being,
[3381.67s - 3383.35s] you know, kind of like busy and stuff
[3383.35s - 3385.91s] will actually create the most effectiveness.
[3385.91s - 3387.67s] But what you just said, this idea of
[3387.67s - 3389.15s] if you start from a place of peace,
[3389.15s - 3391.19s] and I think about that, I completely agree with that.
[3391.19s - 3393.87s] If you walk into something with stillness,
[3393.87s - 3396.95s] it gives you clarity, it gives you perspective,
[3396.95s - 3398.83s] you can zoom out, you can zoom in.
[3398.83s - 3400.87s] If you're buzzing around and moving around,
[3400.87s - 3401.87s] you lose all of that.
[3401.87s - 3403.83s] It's all blurry and fuzzy.
[3403.83s - 3406.47s] And I want to ask you what's,
[3406.47s - 3412.73s] what's a lesson you wish you learned earlier in life?
[3412.73s - 3415.73s] I think it's that what you're searching for externally,
[3415.73s - 3417.73s] you're actually searching for yourself.
[3418.97s - 3420.29s] I think that's become very apparent to me
[3420.29s - 3421.53s] in the past few years is,
[3421.73s - 3425.21s] I was always looking for somebody to give me love,
[3425.21s - 3426.41s] somebody to give me acceptance,
[3426.41s - 3428.89s] to achieve so that I could be accepted.
[3428.89s - 3431.93s] And what I actually truly think is
[3431.93s - 3433.65s] what I was searching for from everyone else
[3433.65s - 3435.13s] is what I was searching for for myself.
[3435.13s - 3437.25s] So a lot of people that are,
[3437.25s - 3439.69s] like a lot of people I know are people pleasers,
[3439.69s - 3440.53s] they come to me and rob them,
[3440.53s - 3442.09s] but people pleasers, and it's like,
[3442.09s - 3444.73s] they'll change themselves to try to get love
[3444.73s - 3446.97s] and acceptance from somebody else.
[3446.97s - 3448.65s] But that's just feeling a, you know,
[3448.65s - 3449.49s] it's like a hungry ghost.
[3450.49s - 3451.69s] The food just goes through the ghost.
[3451.69s - 3452.93s] It doesn't go anywhere.
[3452.93s - 3454.21s] And what we're actually searching for
[3454.21s - 3455.61s] is what we're searching that love
[3455.61s - 3457.61s] and acceptance for ourself.
[3457.61s - 3461.21s] And one of the biggest things that I think I've learned
[3461.21s - 3464.69s] in probably the past two years
[3464.69s - 3469.29s] is I was always trying to grow and change myself
[3469.29s - 3471.57s] because there were aspects of myself that I didn't like.
[3471.57s - 3473.85s] And I resented.
[3473.85s - 3477.13s] And what I've changed it to in the past couple of years
[3477.13s - 3480.01s] is I'm going to love every aspect of myself.
[3480.01s - 3482.37s] So there's some parts of Rob that are beautiful,
[3482.37s - 3486.53s] that are amazing, that love people that want to connect.
[3486.53s - 3488.49s] There's some great parts of Rob.
[3488.49s - 3490.77s] There's some parts of Rob also that are very selfish,
[3490.77s - 3492.17s] that are very judgmental,
[3492.17s - 3495.49s] that are a little bit short,
[3495.49s - 3497.93s] not as present as he should be.
[3497.93s - 3500.49s] Instead of trying to change those and hate those,
[3500.49s - 3502.77s] I've actually just tried to love them
[3502.77s - 3506.49s] and realized that the selfish Rob that exists
[3506.49s - 3510.93s] was some sort of thing that was part of past conditioning
[3510.93s - 3513.81s] that came up from needing to be selfish as a child
[3513.81s - 3515.41s] for whatever it might have been,
[3515.41s - 3517.17s] whatever reasons it might have been.
[3517.17s - 3518.33s] And I can love that side of me.
[3518.33s - 3521.93s] And what I realized is that if I try to change it,
[3521.93s - 3523.97s] it gets stronger.
[3523.97s - 3527.37s] If I love it and I accept it, it kind of chills out.
[3527.37s - 3528.45s] And it doesn't disappear.
[3528.45s - 3531.17s] Like I'm not like, yeah, these parts of me don't exist.
[3531.17s - 3534.69s] It's me looking like internal family systems is a therapy
[3534.73s - 3537.93s] where you look at all parts of you and who you are
[3537.93s - 3540.17s] and you try to figure out a way to understand
[3540.17s - 3542.49s] how the entire orchestra works together.
[3542.49s - 3544.21s] You know, when I was writing my book,
[3545.17s - 3548.37s] I was sitting there and I was going so hardcore,
[3548.37s - 3550.13s] like you and I come from the world
[3550.13s - 3552.65s] of creating viral videos.
[3552.65s - 3555.97s] I would spend so much time on every single line
[3555.97s - 3557.69s] to make sure it was perfect, right?
[3557.69s - 3558.97s] Cause I wanted to make sure like,
[3558.97s - 3561.97s] I've only got 30 seconds or a minute to get the message
[3561.97s - 3563.37s] to be as clear and concise as possible.
[3563.37s - 3564.89s] Let me try to make it as perfect as possible.
[3564.89s - 3566.13s] And I used to do a lot of poetry
[3566.13s - 3567.65s] and I used to do a lot of songwriting when I was younger.
[3567.65s - 3570.33s] So I was used to making every line as potent as I could.
[3570.33s - 3573.21s] As I was writing this book, I was like 16 rounds of edits
[3573.21s - 3575.21s] in editing every single piece of it.
[3575.21s - 3576.89s] And there was a part of me that said,
[3576.89s - 3578.41s] it said, why are you doing this?
[3578.41s - 3580.59s] Like, why are you doing this?
[3580.59s - 3582.09s] And I was like, I want to write a book
[3582.09s - 3583.85s] that helps people and changes people's lives.
[3583.85s - 3586.13s] I want someone to not note the Mindset Mentor Podcasts,
[3586.13s - 3587.77s] but they walk into Barnes & Noble, they see this book
[3587.77s - 3589.25s] and they're like, interesting, let me read it.
[3589.25s - 3590.13s] Let me pick it up.
[3590.13s - 3592.77s] And they read it and it changes their life.
[3592.81s - 3595.01s] And then I played devil's advocate and I said,
[3595.01s - 3597.41s] but you also want it to be successful, don't you?
[3597.41s - 3600.83s] You also want it to be a New York Times bestseller.
[3600.83s - 3602.57s] So you can have a little badge to put on yourself
[3602.57s - 3603.97s] and say, New York Times bestseller.
[3603.97s - 3606.29s] You want it to be this incredibly selling thing
[3606.29s - 3607.41s] because you know, if it takes off,
[3607.41s - 3609.33s] you're gonna make great money for a very long time
[3609.33s - 3610.89s] if it's a perennial seller.
[3610.89s - 3612.65s] And I thought to myself, okay,
[3612.65s - 3616.07s] can I use that ego excited of me
[3616.07s - 3618.53s] to actually help me create a better book?
[3618.53s - 3619.37s] And I could.
[3619.37s - 3621.69s] And so what I realized is instead of hating that aspect,
[3621.69s - 3622.87s] it's like a tool in my tool belt.
[3622.87s - 3625.25s] When I need to bring that side of me out,
[3625.25s - 3627.13s] I can bring that side of me out and say,
[3627.13s - 3629.49s] you know what, I'm gonna create the best freaking book
[3629.49s - 3631.17s] that I can or the best podcast that I can
[3631.17s - 3634.41s] or the best reel that I can to try to impact people.
[3634.41s - 3638.33s] And so it's not about like trying to force change on myself.
[3638.33s - 3640.97s] It's about loving every aspect of myself,
[3640.97s - 3642.41s] the quote unquote, good and bad,
[3642.41s - 3643.49s] even though there is no good or bad,
[3643.49s - 3645.41s] but every aspect of Rob.
[3645.41s - 3648.25s] And if I need to use it, I can bring it up and say,
[3648.25s - 3650.69s] hey, Rob, I need this version of you right now,
[3650.69s - 3652.37s] but I'm not going to fight it anymore.
[3652.37s - 3653.21s] Yeah, yeah.
[3653.21s - 3655.17s] And the monastery would always talk about how
[3655.17s - 3658.61s] the word is anartha, which means unwanted thing
[3658.61s - 3662.21s] that seems unwanted actually needs to be engaged.
[3662.21s - 3664.45s] Like you need to engage it in the service
[3664.45s - 3667.13s] of doing something higher for it to be purified.
[3667.13s - 3668.37s] Like you can't just cut it out.
[3668.37s - 3669.29s] You can't just get rid of it.
[3669.29s - 3671.45s] You can't just hate it to go away.
[3671.45s - 3673.75s] You can't just shame it away.
[3673.75s - 3675.21s] You can't just guilt it away.
[3675.21s - 3678.33s] It has to be engaged in a higher service,
[3678.33s - 3680.37s] i.e. impacting others, helping others,
[3680.37s - 3682.53s] improving your own life, improving the lives of others.
[3682.53s - 3685.09s] Because when it's engaged, then it becomes purified.
[3685.09s - 3688.33s] Because if you just ignore it, it will just stay there.
[3688.33s - 3689.85s] And if you try and push it away,
[3689.85s - 3693.09s] it's gonna push back and get stronger.
[3693.09s - 3695.17s] But if you engage it and go, yeah, you know what?
[3695.17s - 3696.01s] I do have that in me,
[3696.01s - 3697.97s] but I'm going to use that tendency
[3697.97s - 3700.25s] to try and help this person do this.
[3700.25s - 3703.17s] That's the only way that it starts to be purified.
[3703.17s - 3705.21s] And so that resonates very strongly.
[3705.21s - 3706.05s] Great answer.
[3706.05s - 3707.21s] The other one I want to ask you was,
[3707.25s - 3711.92s] what's a lesson you have to learn the hard way?
[3711.92s - 3712.76s] Yeah.
[3712.76s - 3714.24s] I think the one that's been the most potent
[3714.24s - 3716.76s] for a long time is you can't do it all on your own.
[3718.00s - 3720.88s] For me, I don't think I was able to trust people
[3720.88s - 3722.06s] for a very long time.
[3723.00s - 3724.48s] You know, I went to a therapist one time
[3724.48s - 3727.48s] and he had said, yeah, you've been neglected.
[3727.48s - 3728.96s] And I was like, no, I haven't been neglected.
[3728.96s - 3731.08s] Like I had food, water, shelter, clothing,
[3731.08s - 3731.92s] all these things.
[3731.92s - 3733.12s] And he's like, no, you were emotionally neglected
[3733.12s - 3734.48s] from your father.
[3734.48s - 3738.40s] And I was like, oh my God, that really like rings true.
[3738.40s - 3741.92s] But what happened was I had developed this feeling
[3741.92s - 3744.20s] over my lifetime of I've got to do it alone.
[3744.20s - 3745.20s] I can't trust anybody.
[3745.20s - 3746.52s] No one else can do it for me.
[3746.52s - 3748.60s] You know, like there were times when my dad would,
[3748.60s - 3750.48s] even though he was an amazing person,
[3750.48s - 3751.68s] I always tell people like I was,
[3751.68s - 3754.68s] I'm so grateful that I had the father that I had.
[3754.68s - 3757.04s] He was, he never beat me.
[3757.04s - 3757.88s] He never yelled at me.
[3757.88s - 3759.04s] He never touched me inappropriately.
[3759.04s - 3760.56s] He would just get drunk and fall asleep.
[3760.56s - 3761.80s] And when he fell asleep,
[3761.80s - 3763.96s] he'd forget about me in a lot of different ways, right?
[3763.96s - 3765.88s] So there was that neglect of like, I might,
[3765.88s - 3767.12s] he would say, I'm gonna come pick you up
[3767.12s - 3769.40s] and we're gonna go fishing because I lived in Florida.
[3769.40s - 3771.14s] And I, you know, would sit on the front porch
[3771.14s - 3773.20s] for an hour or two hours in my fishing pole
[3773.20s - 3775.16s] and he would just never show up, right?
[3775.16s - 3776.68s] And so there were, there were aspects of that.
[3776.68s - 3778.12s] And I think somewhere along the line,
[3778.12s - 3782.16s] I developed this feeling of like, no one's gonna help me.
[3782.16s - 3783.88s] I have to do it all on my own.
[3783.88s - 3785.00s] Which there's a piece of that,
[3785.00s - 3786.72s] which there is some truth, right?
[3786.72s - 3788.68s] Like I do have to sometimes step forward
[3788.68s - 3790.68s] and be the person to do it.
[3790.68s - 3792.04s] But for the longest time,
[3792.08s - 3794.68s] I never understood the phrase, no man is an island.
[3794.68s - 3797.88s] Cause I was like, I have done everything by myself.
[3797.88s - 3799.32s] And then I started looking around me
[3799.32s - 3800.80s] and I was like, no, I haven't.
[3800.80s - 3802.36s] The universe has always been there,
[3802.36s - 3804.56s] giving me everything that I need in every person
[3804.56s - 3807.66s] to help me in some sort of way, improving, get better.
[3807.66s - 3809.40s] And, you know, as everything's grown,
[3809.40s - 3812.32s] the podcast has grown, my company has grown all this stuff.
[3812.32s - 3813.80s] We have 30 people on the team.
[3813.80s - 3816.26s] Like I can't do it on my own.
[3816.26s - 3819.96s] I can't help people on my own the way that I wish that I could.
[3819.96s - 3821.48s] If I was, I'm not 30 people.
[3821.48s - 3823.28s] I don't have 30 days, you know,
[3823.28s - 3825.84s] they can get done and we can get done in one day
[3825.84s - 3827.60s] that I could get done an entire month.
[3827.60s - 3833.00s] And so what's been big for me is trusting people
[3833.00s - 3836.96s] to be able to help me and to be able to ask for help.
[3836.96s - 3838.38s] Whether that be in a business,
[3838.38s - 3840.92s] but also like going to my wife and be like,
[3840.92s - 3842.24s] hey, I'm really struggling right now.
[3842.24s - 3844.28s] Like, can you just talk to me for a few minutes?
[3844.28s - 3846.96s] And knowing that she doesn't think like,
[3846.96s - 3849.92s] oh, he's not man enough, which is a fear that I had.
[3849.92s - 3851.48s] Like, oh, if I go to her with my problems,
[3851.48s - 3853.20s] she's going to be like, he's not man enough.
[3853.20s - 3855.20s] But for her to be like, yeah, let me hold space for you.
[3855.20s - 3856.04s] Let's talk it out.
[3856.04s - 3858.12s] And so I think the biggest thing for me is like,
[3858.12s - 3860.96s] is learning that I can't do it all on my own.
[3860.96s - 3863.64s] It's okay to, it's actually strength to ask for help.
[3863.64s - 3865.28s] It's strong to ask for help.
[3865.28s - 3868.90s] And that I need to be better at asking for help
[3868.90s - 3870.42s] when I do need it.
[3870.42s - 3871.32s] That's a great one.
[3871.32s - 3874.54s] That's a great one I can relate to in so many ways.
[3874.54s - 3876.54s] And yeah, it strikes a chord for sure.
[3876.54s - 3878.88s] And I think so many of us, you know,
[3878.88s - 3880.70s] both of those questions, think about it.
[3880.70s - 3882.50s] You know, what's taking,
[3882.50s - 3883.90s] what's a lesson you learned the hard way
[3883.90s - 3886.26s] and what's a lesson you wished you learned earlier.
[3886.26s - 3890.64s] And write them down because you might forget it.
[3890.64s - 3893.28s] And you kind of fall back in that cycle often.
[3893.28s - 3897.04s] Rob, we end every on-purpose episode with a final five.
[3897.04s - 3898.92s] These questions have to be answered in one word
[3898.92s - 3900.36s] to one sentence maximum.
[3900.36s - 3901.20s] Oh my God, okay.
[3901.20s - 3904.72s] And so, I'm so wordy, that's a, I'll do my best.
[3904.72s - 3905.92s] Rob, these are your final five.
[3905.92s - 3906.76s] The first question is,
[3906.76s - 3910.08s] what is the best advice you've ever heard or received?
[3910.08s - 3912.48s] I'll give you the sentence.
[3912.48s - 3913.76s] And if you want me to explain it, I can,
[3913.76s - 3915.68s] but everything is your fault.
[3915.68s - 3916.96s] Yeah, you can explain it.
[3916.96s - 3918.20s] Everything is your fault comes back
[3918.20s - 3920.36s] to like you are the CEO of your life.
[3920.36s - 3921.84s] My very first mentor that I had,
[3921.84s - 3924.52s] I paid $500 a month to have my first coach
[3924.52s - 3926.96s] when I was 19, about to turn 20.
[3926.96s - 3928.64s] And we worked together for two years
[3928.64s - 3929.64s] and we had some great calls.
[3929.64s - 3932.12s] I don't remember any of them, I remember one.
[3932.12s - 3935.12s] And what it was was I had made so many excuses
[3935.12s - 3936.44s] as to why I was late to calls,
[3936.44s - 3937.52s] why I didn't hit my assignments,
[3937.52s - 3939.24s] why I didn't do what I needed to do.
[3939.28s - 3940.80s] And he had this really tough conversation.
[3940.80s - 3943.40s] I mean, he said, Rob, if a business succeeds,
[3943.40s - 3945.12s] whose fault is it?
[3945.12s - 3946.72s] And I was like, I mean, what do you mean?
[3946.72s - 3947.96s] He's like, if a business succeeds,
[3947.96s - 3950.84s] all 1,000 employees move into the direction
[3950.84s - 3952.80s] they have a successful year, whose fault is it
[3952.80s - 3955.12s] that the person who orchestrated, I was like, the CEO.
[3955.12s - 3957.12s] He said, if a business fails, whose fault is it?
[3957.12s - 3959.08s] And I said, the CEO, he said, Rob,
[3959.08s - 3960.48s] if you get to the end of your life
[3960.48s - 3962.12s] and it's not what you wanted it to be
[3962.12s - 3963.90s] and you didn't create the life that you wanted to,
[3963.90s - 3965.52s] make the money that you wanted to have the success,
[3965.52s - 3967.12s] the love, the happiness, travel to places
[3967.12s - 3969.12s] that you wanted to, whose fault would it be?
[3969.12s - 3970.12s] And I said, it'd be my fault.
[3970.12s - 3971.60s] And he said, if you did create the life
[3971.60s - 3973.16s] that you wanted to, you had the love, the happiness,
[3973.16s - 3974.72s] the abundance, everything that you wanted,
[3974.72s - 3976.24s] whose fault would that be?
[3976.24s - 3977.88s] And I said, it'd be my fault.
[3977.88s - 3980.16s] And he said, the problem with you is you're treating this,
[3980.16s - 3982.48s] treating this life as if you're the victim.
[3982.48s - 3983.96s] And what you need to realize that everything
[3983.96s - 3985.60s] that happens to you is your fault
[3985.60s - 3987.72s] and that your life won't change until you decide
[3987.72s - 3989.60s] that you want to be the CEO of your life.
[3989.60s - 3991.12s] How do you know how that would have felt
[3991.12s - 3992.20s] when you heard it at that point?
[3992.20s - 3993.04s] It would hurt.
[3993.04s - 3993.88s] Yeah, exactly.
[3993.88s - 3995.96s] With that mindset, like, and I think a lot of people today
[3995.96s - 3999.60s] would find that offensive, they might get hurt by it,
[3999.60s - 4004.60s] they might, how did you transfer that energy to be like,
[4005.32s - 4007.72s] no, this is actually helpful, it's not hurtful?
[4007.72s - 4010.40s] Yeah, I mean, I was a little bit hurt,
[4010.40s - 4013.44s] but I felt truth.
[4013.44s - 4015.04s] I felt like, yeah, he's right.
[4015.04s - 4017.64s] Cause when I look at the path of where my life
[4017.64s - 4021.68s] was going to go, had I continued to blame everybody else,
[4021.68s - 4023.24s] it wasn't going to be good.
[4023.24s - 4025.44s] But when I looked at people who I knew
[4025.48s - 4027.20s] who took full ownership of their life,
[4027.20s - 4030.24s] one of my, probably my first mentor
[4030.24s - 4032.76s] without even it being on purpose was my uncle Dan,
[4032.76s - 4035.48s] who was an incredibly successful guy,
[4036.68s - 4038.08s] had a bunch of success,
[4038.08s - 4040.84s] but also was incredibly giving, always so loving.
[4040.84s - 4045.20s] And he never blamed anybody else for when his business failed
[4045.20s - 4047.88s] and he brought it back from nothing and rebuilt it.
[4047.88s - 4049.12s] He never blamed anybody else.
[4049.12s - 4050.64s] He was always there for everyone else,
[4050.68s - 4055.72s] but he always took everything as his responsibility.
[4055.72s - 4059.08s] And it's like, not everything that's happened to you
[4059.08s - 4060.32s] in your life is your fault,
[4060.32s - 4061.48s] but whatever it is that you have,
[4061.48s - 4063.12s] it is your responsibility to work through.
[4063.12s - 4064.48s] Will Smith also said this, right?
[4064.48s - 4066.44s] Where it's like, it's not my fault
[4066.44s - 4067.80s] that my father was an alcoholic,
[4067.80s - 4070.00s] but it's my responsibility to do with what,
[4070.00s - 4072.60s] do with it because it's the reality that I have.
[4072.60s - 4073.60s] And I have to work through those things.
[4073.60s - 4075.88s] And so for me, it was like, it rang really true
[4075.88s - 4078.16s] where I was like, okay, it's right.
[4078.16s - 4079.84s] And if my life is going to change,
[4079.88s - 4081.36s] I have to be the person to change it.
[4081.36s - 4083.28s] And that's when it like clicked for me.
[4083.28s - 4087.20s] That conversation I could say is absolutely 100%
[4087.20s - 4090.36s] the one conversation that changed my life completely.
[4090.36s - 4091.60s] Powerful.
[4091.60s - 4093.84s] Second question, what is the worst advice
[4093.84s - 4095.20s] you've ever heard or received?
[4095.20s - 4096.76s] Fit in with everybody else.
[4097.84s - 4099.00s] Good.
[4099.00s - 4100.04s] Question number three,
[4100.04s - 4103.19s] what is your most repeated thought?
[4103.19s - 4106.31s] As of recently is I'm proud of you.
[4107.78s - 4109.78s] I try to tell myself that every single day.
[4109.78s - 4110.98s] My mom told me that a lot as a kid.
[4110.98s - 4113.46s] I'm trying to repeat it to myself.
[4113.46s - 4114.30s] I love that.
[4114.30s - 4115.58s] That's a great one.
[4115.58s - 4119.09s] Question number four, the number one habit
[4119.09s - 4120.89s] that changed your life.
[4120.89s - 4125.72s] Like a daily habit, like something that you practice.
[4125.72s - 4127.12s] Meditation and breath work.
[4128.66s - 4131.05s] Finding space for myself.
[4131.05s - 4131.89s] Love it.
[4131.89s - 4133.25s] Fifth and final question.
[4133.25s - 4135.01s] If you could create one law
[4135.01s - 4137.01s] that everyone in the world had to follow,
[4137.01s - 4138.21s] what would it be?
[4138.21s - 4139.05s] Oh my God.
[4139.05s - 4139.89s] Take your time.
[4140.89s - 4144.77s] One law that everybody in the world has to follow
[4144.77s - 4148.69s] to take five minutes every single day
[4148.69s - 4151.09s] to practice self-awareness.
[4151.09s - 4154.93s] I think that every problem in this world could be solved
[4154.93s - 4156.53s] if people were more self-aware.
[4156.53s - 4158.41s] I think that all of our problems
[4158.41s - 4160.61s] come from lack of self-awareness.
[4160.61s - 4164.49s] And if people are more aware of our actions,
[4164.49s - 4166.25s] if politicians are more aware of their actions
[4166.25s - 4169.05s] and how it's affecting the entire world,
[4169.09s - 4171.97s] and if parents were aware of how their actions
[4171.97s - 4174.89s] are affecting their children and as a son,
[4174.89s - 4178.89s] if I'm aware of how my actions are affecting my mom,
[4178.89s - 4181.61s] my sister, my wife, everybody around me,
[4181.61s - 4183.01s] if we could take five minutes
[4183.01s - 4184.69s] to practice being more self-aware,
[4184.69s - 4186.97s] I think that the entire world would be better.
[4186.97s - 4187.81s] I love that.
[4187.81s - 4190.77s] Rob Dahl, everyone, the book is called Level Up.
[4190.77s - 4193.01s] How to Get Focus, Stop Procrastinating
[4193.01s - 4194.01s] and Upgrade Your Life.
[4194.01s - 4196.17s] If you don't have a copy, go and grab it already.
[4196.17s - 4198.49s] You'll be able to see my testimony right here
[4198.93s - 4199.77s] on the back.
[4199.77s - 4200.89s] You're at the top on the back there.
[4200.89s - 4202.41s] Make sure you go and grab a copy
[4202.41s - 4206.77s] and tag me and Rob on Instagram, on X, on TikTok,
[4206.77s - 4208.89s] with what resonated with you, what connected with you.
[4208.89s - 4211.41s] I love seeing and I want Rob to see as well
[4211.41s - 4212.41s] what you're practicing,
[4212.41s - 4215.01s] what you're trying to put into action in your life
[4215.01s - 4216.61s] and I can't wait for you to level up.
[4216.61s - 4217.65s] Rob, thank you again.
[4217.65s - 4218.49s] Thank you, man.
[4218.49s - 4220.17s] For coming on and opening your heart
[4220.17s - 4222.01s] and being so vulnerable and at the same time,
[4222.01s - 4224.05s] giving so many practical insights
[4224.05s - 4225.97s] of how people can move from where they are
[4225.97s - 4227.57s] to where they really want to be
[4227.57s - 4228.73s] and even deeper.
[4228.73s - 4229.73s] So thank you so much, man.
[4229.73s - 4230.57s] I appreciate it.
[4230.57s - 4231.41s] Well, thank you, Jay.
[4231.41s - 4233.21s] I've known you for seven years now
[4233.21s - 4236.69s] and your inspiration for doing good in the world.
[4236.69s - 4240.13s] And I can see that the actions that you take
[4240.13s - 4241.77s] are from your heart and from a place of purpose
[4241.77s - 4243.61s] and it's inspiring for me to always see that.
[4243.61s - 4244.45s] Thank you, man.
[4244.45s - 4245.29s] I appreciate it, of course.
[4245.29s - 4246.13s] Thank you.
[4246.13s - 4247.17s] If you love this episode,
[4247.17s - 4250.41s] you'll love my interview with Dr. Gabor Mate
[4250.41s - 4252.57s] on understanding your trauma
[4252.57s - 4254.85s] and how to heal emotional wounds
[4254.85s - 4257.21s] to start moving on from the past.
[4257.21s - 4259.17s] Everything in nature grows only where it's vulnerable.
[4259.17s - 4262.29s] So a tree doesn't grow where it's hard and thick, does it?
[4262.29s - 4264.85s] It grows where it's soft and green and vulnerable.
