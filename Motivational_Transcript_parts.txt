[47.31s - 49.71s] you might not be able to change what's around you.
[49.71s - 51.51s] So change how you view it.
[51.51s - 54.39s] There is no rose in the world
[54.39s - 56.87s] that grows the day you plant the seed.
[56.87s - 61.15s] It takes months, sometimes even years,
[61.15s - 65.39s] for a tree to have a beautiful fruit or a beautiful flower.
[65.39s - 68.23s] If you're feeling like you're caught in a spiral
[68.23s - 70.83s] of the same thing after the same thing,
[70.83s - 73.58s] life is trying to teach you something.
[73.58s - 75.14s] Go to the school of life.
[75.14s - 78.10s] Jay, I think when things feel dark,
[78.10s - 80.06s] the job in life is to glow.
[80.06s - 86.94s] And you've definitely taught me how to do that.
[86.94s - 88.54s] So before we get into this episode,
[88.54s - 90.30s] the team here at the Mel Robbins podcast
[90.30s - 91.78s] shared some data with me.
[91.78s - 93.46s] I love my data and research.
[93.46s - 96.46s] 57% of you who watch the Mel Robbins podcast
[96.46s - 99.98s] here on YouTube are not subscribed to this channel.
[99.98s - 100.86s] And here's the deal.

[136.62s - 140.62s] and I am absolutely thrilled that you are here.

[146.94s - 148.22s] to be together with you.
[148.22s - 149.94s] And if you're a brand new listener,

[164.26s - 166.74s] And because you hit play on this episode,
[166.74s - 168.62s] I already know something about you.
[168.62s - 171.82s] I know that you're someone who values your time
[171.82s - 175.82s] because you're making time to listen to a conversation
[175.82s - 179.70s] that will give you greater clarity, purpose and direction.
[179.70s - 182.78s] I also suspect that you're looking for some answers
[182.78s - 185.98s] for a way to make sense of what's going on in your life
[185.98s - 188.78s] and for guidance on how to move forward.
[188.78s - 190.54s] If someone sent you this episode,
[190.54s - 192.66s] I want to take a moment and point something out
[192.66s - 194.18s] that's really important.
[194.18s - 197.22s] You have people in your life who love you
[197.22s - 200.66s] and they want you to experience this conversation
[200.66s - 204.06s] because they are certain that what you're about to hear
[204.14s - 205.78s] will change your life.
[205.78s - 209.06s] It'll open you up to bigger possibilities.
[209.06s - 211.46s] And I want you to really listen today
[211.46s - 215.10s] and take in everything that you're about to learn
[215.10s - 219.43s] because if you do, time will slow down.
[219.43s - 222.03s] Your heart will soften.
[222.03s - 224.95s] Your guard will drop.
[224.95s - 227.68s] Your mind will expand
[227.68s - 231.72s] and you will know with every cell of your being
[231.72s - 234.00s] that what you're hearing today
[234.04s - 238.22s] is meant just for you because it is.
[238.22s - 241.86s] Jay Shetty is a person who is so hard to define
[241.86s - 244.78s] because the impact that he has on people's lives
[244.78s - 248.62s] transcends a label and it is truly global.
[248.62s - 251.46s] I consider Jay to be one of my closest friends,
[251.46s - 253.70s] especially in this business.
[253.70s - 255.94s] To the world, he's known as the host
[255.94s - 257.30s] of one of the most successful
[257.30s - 259.86s] and award-winning podcasts on the planet.
[259.86s - 262.78s] I'm talking about on purpose with Jay Shetty.
[262.78s - 265.30s] He is also the number one New York Times
[265.30s - 267.70s] best-selling author of two books,
[267.70s - 270.50s] Think Like a Monk and Eight Rules of Love,
[270.50s - 274.10s] which have been translated into over 47 languages.
[274.10s - 277.94s] Jay is also the chief purpose officer for calm,
[277.94s - 281.50s] the wildly, wildly popular meditation app.
