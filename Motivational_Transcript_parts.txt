[204.10s - 205.74s] will change your life.
[205.74s - 209.02s] It'll open you up to bigger possibilities.
[209.02s - 211.42s] And I want you to really listen today
[211.42s - 215.10s] and take in everything that you're about to learn
[215.10s - 219.39s] because if you do, time will slow down.
[219.39s - 222.03s] Your heart will soften.
[222.03s - 224.91s] Your guard will drop.
[224.91s - 227.64s] Your mind will expand.
[227.64s - 231.72s] And you will know with every cell of your being
[231.72s - 236.34s] that what you're hearing today is meant just for you
[236.34s - 238.18s] because it is.
[238.18s - 241.82s] Jay Shetty is a person who is so hard to define
[241.82s - 244.78s] because the impact that he has on people's lives
[244.78s - 248.58s] transcends a label and it is truly global.
[248.58s - 251.42s] I consider Jay to be one of my closest friends,
[251.42s - 253.70s] especially in this business.
[253.70s - 255.90s] To the world, he's known as the host
[255.90s - 257.30s] of one of the most successful
[257.30s - 259.86s] and award-winning podcasts on the planet.   
[259.86s - 262.74s] I'm talking about on purpose with Jay Shetty.
[262.74s - 265.30s] He is also the number one New York Times
[265.30s - 267.70s] best-selling author of two books,
[267.70s - 270.50s] Think Like a Monk and Eight Rules of Love,
[270.50s - 274.10s] which have been translated into over 47 languages.
[274.10s - 277.94s] Jay is also the chief purpose officer for calm,
[277.94s - 281.54s] the wildly, wildly popular meditation app.
[281.54s - 284.90s] He is a former monk who has reinvented himself
[284.90s - 287.06s] over and over again.
[287.06s - 289.86s] And his work and his life are gonna help you find
[289.86s - 292.46s] greater purpose and meaning in yours.
[292.46s - 294.02s] Please help me welcome
[294.02s - 298.50s] the remarkable Jay Shetty to the Mel Robbins podcast.
[298.50s - 303.10s] Oh my gosh, Jay Shetty in the house in Boston.
[303.10s - 307.94s] This is just, I've been waiting to welcome you in.
[307.94s - 311.82s] Here in person, Jay, my friend, I'm so excited you're here.
[311.82s - 315.06s] Mel, you're the best in seeing your entire team
[315.06s - 317.38s] and your beautiful studio space.
[317.38s - 319.42s] I mean, it's incredible when you get to see
[319.42s - 322.30s] your friend's place of genius.
[322.30s - 325.38s] And I feel so lucky to be able to walk into it today.
[325.38s - 327.74s] And it truly is infused with all your energy.
[327.74s - 329.58s] So it's so beautiful to be here.
[329.58s - 332.38s] I'm so grateful to be on your incredible podcast,
[332.38s - 335.90s] the way you've been serving and showing up for people
[335.90s - 337.38s] and truly putting your heart there.
[337.38s - 338.46s] And I want people to know,
[338.46s - 341.94s] not just in the last 24 months for decades
[341.94s - 345.50s] of just showing up for people, privately, personally,
[345.50s - 347.34s] publicly, it's incredible to watch
[347.34s - 348.38s] and I'm grateful to be your friend.
[348.38s - 349.22s] So thank you.
[349.22s - 350.82s] Oh, Jay, you're gonna make me cry.
[350.82s - 351.66s] Thank you.
[351.66s - 353.62s] So that, okay, I gotta pull myself together.
[355.06s - 357.54s] I would love to start by having you speak directly
[357.54s - 360.98s] to the person who is with us right now.
[360.98s - 362.38s] How might they feel different
[362.38s - 364.34s] if they take everything to heart
[364.34s - 366.62s] that you're about to share with us today,
[366.62s - 367.86s] wisdom that you've learned,
[367.86s - 371.42s] lessons that you wanna share, mistakes that you've made.
[371.42s - 374.05s] What could change about their life?
[374.05s - 377.23s] I believe if someone really listens today
[377.23s - 382.23s] and then reflects and then applies what we share,
[382.23s - 386.11s] I believe their mind will become their best friend,
[386.11s - 387.95s] not their worst enemy.
[387.95s - 392.95s] I believe that time will feel like it's full of possibilities,
[394.07s - 395.91s] not just full of pressure,
[395.91s - 398.76s] which is what we so often feel with time.
[398.76s - 403.87s] And I really believe that their life will feel clear
[403.87s - 407.14s] and less foggy and less undecided.
[407.14s - 410.78s] And they'll actually know their next move, their next step.
[410.78s - 412.18s] Maybe not the whole picture,
[412.18s - 415.46s] maybe not this big idea of the future
[415.46s - 418.90s] that we all seem to overwhelm ourselves with,
[418.90s - 421.54s] but they'll know their next step, their next move.
[421.54s - 423.98s] And they'll feel confident and secure
[423.98s - 425.02s] that it's the right step.
[425.02s - 428.42s] So I'd say that's what they'll get from listening today
[428.42s - 430.38s] and reflecting and applying.
[430.38s - 435.38s] I couldn't help but notice that you said listen and reflect
[436.26s - 439.60s] and then at the end you said reflecting.
[439.60s - 443.20s] Why is that so important to not just listen and then do,
[443.20s - 445.60s] but to actually take that moment and reflect?
[445.60s - 447.04s] Well, here's the interesting thing, Mel.
[447.04s - 448.60s] I think what we don't realize
[448.60s - 453.60s] is that there's actually five steps from listening to change.
[453.60s - 454.44s] What?
[454.44s - 456.84s] Yeah, there's five in between, but they're very simple.
[456.84s - 459.60s] And if we actually follow them, we're guaranteed success.
[459.60s - 461.08s] So the first is learn.
[461.08s - 463.16s] The fact that people are listening to us today,
[463.16s - 465.56s] the fact that people follow you, they read your books,
[465.56s - 467.00s] they may listen to mine,
[467.00s - 469.36s] they get the opportunity to learn.
[469.36s - 470.20s] But what's the difference?
[470.20s - 471.72s] We know lots of people that learn,
[471.72s - 473.40s] but never get to change their life.
[473.40s - 474.24s] So what's going wrong?
[474.24s - 475.68s] What's the missing part?
[475.68s - 478.68s] After learning, we have to experiment.
[478.68s - 480.16s] You've got to try this out.
[480.16s - 482.36s] You may try it out tomorrow and it may not work.
[482.36s - 484.60s] You may try it out on Wednesday and it will work perfectly.
[484.60s - 486.12s] You may try out in a week
[486.12s - 487.28s] and then there'll be a little dip.
[487.28s - 489.00s] So experiment with it.
[489.00s - 491.56s] Don't feel like it's going to be perfect tomorrow.
[491.56s - 493.32s] Play with it, have fun with it.
[493.32s - 495.12s] And then the third step is perform.
[495.12s - 498.16s] Once you've experimented, you get into a groove.
[498.16s - 499.72s] You start to feel it working.
[499.72s - 502.00s] You start to notice it in your body.
[502.00s - 504.68s] Your mindset feels different when you wake up in the morning.
[504.68s - 508.04s] Now you don't have to do all the conscious stuff anymore.
[508.04s - 509.44s] It's kind of unconscious.
[509.44s - 511.88s] And then finally, there'll always be struggle
[511.88s - 514.00s] just before you're about to unlock
[514.00s - 515.36s] this new level of greatness.
[515.36s - 517.20s] And then finally, there's thrive.
[517.20s - 519.56s] So to me, that reflection process
[519.56s - 521.68s] is those three steps in between
[521.68s - 525.04s] of experimenting, performing and struggling.
[525.04s - 527.40s] It's the ability to try something out,
[527.40s - 528.76s] then reflect back and go,
[528.76s - 530.40s] wait, how could I have done that?
[530.40s - 531.96s] 1% different.
[531.96s - 533.72s] How could I have done that 2% different?
[533.72s - 534.92s] What do I need to shift?
[534.92s - 536.96s] And as soon as you start doing that,
[536.96s - 538.48s] you start enjoying reflection.
[538.48s - 540.48s] So reflection's not just in the mind.
[540.48s - 541.60s] It's something you're practicing.
[541.60s - 543.76s] It's something you're experimenting with.
[543.76s - 545.52s] I've never heard anybody explain it that way.
[545.52s - 546.36s] I love that.
[546.36s - 548.40s] Well, it makes so much sense because you're right.
[548.40s - 550.52s] Like I think you can hear an idea
[550.52s - 552.12s] and you can try it once.
[552.12s - 553.88s] And then if it doesn't feel the way you want it
[553.88s - 555.24s] to feel, most people stop.
[555.24s - 556.08s] Yes.
[556.08s - 557.52s] And I've never thought about the fact
[557.52s - 561.24s] that if you don't actually know that trying something
[561.24s - 563.24s] and then reflecting on what worked,
[563.24s - 564.60s] what didn't work, tweaking it,
[564.60s - 566.56s] experimenting, as you said,
[566.56s - 567.60s] you're always going to stop.
[567.60s - 569.08s] Absolutely, absolutely.
[569.08s - 570.84s] And by the way, isn't it just the case,
[570.84s - 574.40s] Mel, that even something that you've done for years,
[574.40s - 576.80s] you still need to keep experimenting with it.
[576.80s - 578.60s] So just because something worked last year
[578.60s - 580.28s] doesn't mean it's going to work this year.
[580.28s - 582.00s] You've got to keep that process going
[582.00s - 584.24s] and that's what makes it fun and alive
[584.24s - 586.64s] and it doesn't become routine and monotonous.
[586.64s - 589.88s] And so I love reflection being in action.
[589.88s - 593.08s] You know, Jay, so many people look to you
[593.08s - 598.08s] because you have written just incredible blockbuster books.
[599.40s - 601.52s] You have millions and millions of followers.
[601.52s - 604.28s] Your podcast is a podcast I listen to.
[604.28s - 607.56s] Your podcast is a podcast that inspired me
[607.56s - 609.28s] to get into the podcasting space.
[609.28s - 610.80s] No, you're going to make me cry.
[610.80s - 611.96s] And so, no, I'm serious.
[611.96s - 614.72s] And so I think there are times in your life
[614.72s - 616.56s] and you've certainly felt this way
[616.56s - 620.80s] where you're really lost and unhappy and you feel stuck
[620.80s - 622.16s] and I know you've been there.
[622.16s - 623.68s] And so I would love to just,
[623.68s - 626.20s] before we kind of dig into specifics
[626.20s - 629.48s] and unpack some of the lessons from your life,
[629.48s - 631.12s] what would you say to somebody
[631.12s - 633.88s] who really does feel kind of lost right now
[633.88s - 636.44s] or stuck or doesn't know what their next move is?
[636.44s - 639.12s] And how do you want the person who feels that way
[639.12s - 641.68s] to think about that moment
[641.68s - 646.06s] where you feel like you don't know what to do next?
[646.06s - 647.46s] I love what you asked there because you said,
[647.46s - 650.26s] how would you like someone to think about that moment?
[650.26s - 652.22s] What I'd like people to remember
[652.22s - 654.45s] is that you're not stuck.
[654.45s - 658.58s] You're actually grieving a past version of yourself.
[658.58s - 661.74s] So there's a part of you that's died
[661.74s - 664.58s] that actually you left behind a long time ago,
[664.58s - 666.90s] but there's a part of you that still misses it.
[666.90s - 668.34s] You still want things to be the same.
[668.34s - 670.26s] You still want things to be that way
[670.26s - 672.58s] and that keeps pulling you back.
[672.58s - 674.06s] And that's actually blocking you
[674.06s - 675.38s] from making the next move.
[675.38s - 678.22s] It's stopping you because life used to be this way
[678.22s - 679.90s] or life used to feel this way.
[679.90s - 683.54s] And so we're stuck not because we don't know what to do next,
[683.54s - 685.50s] we're stuck because there's a part of us
[685.50s - 687.90s] that wants to hold on to what we have here.
[687.90s - 690.46s] There's a beautiful Zen teaching that says,
[690.46s - 694.19s] what's holding you back is what you're holding onto.
[694.19s - 696.51s] And I think if people think about that for a second,
[696.55s - 700.19s] what are you holding onto that's holding you back?
[700.19s - 703.71s] What are you clinging onto that's keeping you stuck?
[703.71s - 707.75s] There's an identity, an idea, a mindset, a behavior,
[707.75s - 711.19s] an attitude that is keeping you held back.
[711.19s - 712.59s] And once you let go of that,
[712.59s - 715.39s] once you open and release your hands,
[715.39s - 717.35s] all of a sudden you feel free.
[717.35s - 719.47s] So what identity, what habit, what mindset,
[719.47s - 724.51s] what expectation are you letting yourself be held back by
[724.55s - 726.07s] that if you were to let go of,
[726.07s - 728.62s] you could easily move forward.
[728.62s - 729.94s] Can you give an example?
[729.94s - 730.78s] You know what I'm saying?
[730.78s - 733.02s] Because I think I understand what you're saying.
[733.02s - 737.10s] Like I'm trying to think about a scenario where,
[737.10s - 740.18s] let's say somebody is at a moment in their life
[740.18s - 741.54s] where there's a change.
[741.54s - 743.74s] You have gone through a breakup
[743.74s - 746.58s] or maybe you've raised your kids and they've launched
[746.58s - 749.06s] and now you're trying to figure out your next chapter.
[749.06s - 752.30s] Maybe you just lost your job.
[752.30s - 754.82s] And now you're like, oh my God, what do I do?
[754.82s - 757.26s] What are the kinds of things that people hold on to
[757.26s - 761.18s] that you may not realize this is what you're actually holding on to?
[761.18s - 762.26s] Yes.
[762.26s - 765.34s] So all three examples you gave apply.
[765.34s - 767.94s] If you've raised your kids and they've left the house,
[767.94s - 769.42s] there's a part of you that misses
[769.42s - 771.90s] what the home felt like with their energy.
[771.90s - 774.34s] And now you spend all your day thinking about
[774.34s - 775.70s] all the memories in the corners.
[775.70s - 778.42s] You look in this corner and you remember your child growing up,
[778.42s - 780.78s] you look in this corner and you remember Christmas dinner,
[780.78s - 782.10s] you look at this place.
[782.10s - 784.06s] So you're constantly surrounding yourself
[784.06s - 787.06s] with an identity that no longer exists.
[787.06s - 790.34s] So you don't have the time or the energy or the presence
[790.34s - 792.66s] to be able to even think about what comes next
[792.66s - 795.10s] because there's a part of you that still feels affected.
[795.10s - 797.34s] If you go through a relationship breakup,
[797.34s - 800.46s] you keep looking at pictures of when you went on vacation.
[800.46s - 802.30s] You keep looking at the pictures
[802.30s - 804.02s] of when you had your first date.
[804.02s - 808.86s] You keep looking at the memories of maybe it's a clothing,
[808.86s - 810.66s] piece of clothing, maybe it's an item at home,
[810.66s - 811.90s] whatever you're surrounded by.
[811.90s - 815.14s] So you're still living as if you're still dating that person
[815.14s - 816.54s] in your mind.
[816.54s - 819.66s] And so that's all holding on to something
[819.66s - 822.74s] that is an identity that's already moved on in life.
[822.74s - 824.38s] Your kids have already moved on,
[824.38s - 827.26s] they're at college or they're getting engaged.
[827.26s - 829.82s] Your ex has already moved on,
[829.82s - 832.94s] they're in a new relationship or they're alone.
[832.94s - 836.26s] So reality has moved on, but you've held on
[836.26s - 837.50s] to the piece of clothing, the memory,
[837.50s - 839.34s] the photo, the whatever it may be.
[839.34s - 841.22s] And that's what's keeping you stuck.
[841.22s - 844.46s] So my question to everyone is, what is that thing for you?
[844.46s - 846.46s] And how do you learn to release it?
[846.46s - 847.34s] That's the focus.
[847.34s - 848.58s] I think we think we're stuck
[848.58s - 850.18s] because we don't know what to do next.
[850.18s - 852.26s] No, we're stuck because we're still holding on
[852.26s - 854.02s] to what's behind us.
[854.02s - 856.90s] And as soon as you release it, you propel yourself forward.
[856.90s - 857.78s] Have you ever felt that before
[857.78s - 859.38s] and you're holding on to something really tight?
[859.38s - 862.02s] If you let go of it, all of a sudden you feel momentum.
[862.02s - 864.38s] Momentum doesn't come from knowing where you're going.
[864.38s - 867.30s] It comes from knowing that I don't want to be here anymore.
[867.30s - 872.46s] That is so important because so many people stay where they are
[872.46s - 875.14s] because they don't know where they want to go next.
[875.14s - 877.22s] And I always say, well, actually,
[877.22s - 879.30s] if you can be honest with yourself
[879.30s - 882.06s] and say, I just don't like how my life feels anymore,
[882.06s - 883.94s] you're already moving in a new direction
[883.94s - 885.58s] because you're moving away from what's not working.
[885.58s - 887.98s] I have one more example to give you
[887.98s - 891.54s] because what you just said was brilliant.
[892.38s - 895.74s] You have this ability, Jay,
[895.74s - 901.37s] to just take wisdom, philosophy, psychology
[901.37s - 904.25s] and make it so immensely obvious
[904.25s - 906.89s] that I both feel inspired and sort of like an idiot
[906.89s - 909.49s] that I didn't see it myself and I'm charged.
[909.49s - 911.97s] But no, I have one more example to give you
[911.97s - 914.45s] about this feeling of being stuck
[914.45s - 917.17s] because there are so many people
[917.17s - 919.85s] that have artistry inside themselves,
[919.89s - 921.81s] whether it's wanting to start a YouTube channel
[921.81s - 924.85s] or it's wanting to become a singer
[924.85s - 929.01s] or it's wanting to express themselves on social media
[929.01s - 931.73s] or it's wanting to learn how to market themselves
[931.73s - 933.21s] better on social media.
[933.21s - 936.53s] And yet there is so much resistance
[936.53s - 938.77s] to putting yourself out there.
[938.77s - 942.01s] And so in this paradigm where we're talking about
[942.01s - 947.21s] holding on to something and grieving who you used to be,
[947.25s - 950.17s] if somebody is actively fighting
[950.17s - 953.25s] against their deep internal desire
[953.25s - 956.21s] to start putting themselves out there in a new chapter,
[956.21s - 957.89s] whether it's marketing a business
[957.89s - 960.37s] or starting a YouTube channel or performing
[960.37s - 962.53s] and singing on whatever it may be,
[962.53s - 964.81s] what is it that you're holding on to?
[964.81s - 967.93s] It's the identity and the reputation
[967.93s - 969.25s] that that identity is built.
[969.25s - 970.33s] Okay, same more about that.
[970.33s - 973.73s] Yes, so it's saying, well, I'm a teacher.
[973.73s - 976.61s] I can't be a social media creator.
[976.61s - 977.45s] I'm a teacher.
[977.45s - 978.89s] That's what my friends know me as.
[978.89s - 980.73s] That's not what my students know me as.
[980.73s - 983.81s] That's what my parents know me as.
[983.81s - 985.21s] That's what my kids know me as.
[985.21s - 988.33s] How can I be a teacher and be a social media creator?
[988.33s - 989.53s] It's not possible.
[989.53s - 990.73s] Oh, I'm a nurse.
[990.73s - 993.53s] How can I be a nurse and a podcaster?
[993.53s - 994.53s] That can't be the case.
[994.53s - 995.61s] What do I have to offer?
[995.61s - 996.85s] I'm a nurse and by the way,
[996.85s - 999.65s] that's what everyone in my social circle knows me as.
[999.65s - 1001.61s] So now if I record a podcast,
[1001.61s - 1003.37s] they're gonna look at me and think,
[1003.37s - 1005.09s] wait, what does she have to say?
[1005.09s - 1007.01s] What are you gonna teach the world?
[1007.01s - 1007.97s] Oh, I'm a mom.
[1007.97s - 1010.41s] I can't be a mom and own a TikTok shop.
[1010.41s - 1011.41s] I don't know how to do that.
[1011.41s - 1012.85s] I didn't go to business school.
[1012.85s - 1014.57s] I didn't, so this is what we do.
[1014.57s - 1018.41s] And the real reason is because our social circle
[1018.41s - 1023.41s] has validated or at least approved that current position.
[1023.41s - 1026.01s] Everyone in our social circle knows what that means.
[1026.01s - 1028.65s] They recognize it and they understand it.
[1028.65s - 1032.13s] As soon as we do something that people don't understand,
[1032.13s - 1034.73s] we're scared that they're not going to like us.
[1034.73s - 1036.53s] And as soon as we think they're not gonna like us
[1036.53s - 1038.73s] for doing something they don't understand,
[1038.73s - 1040.85s] we leave behind what we love.
[1040.85s - 1042.45s] Because we say, well, I can't do it
[1042.45s - 1043.97s] if they're gonna misunderstand me.
[1043.97s - 1045.97s] I can't do it if they're gonna dislike me.
[1045.97s - 1048.65s] I have so many friends right now, Mel, honestly,
[1048.65s - 1051.36s] that are scared to put out a video
[1051.36s - 1055.00s] because they feel the pressure from their own friends.
[1055.00s - 1056.92s] People are not feeling pressure from the world.
[1056.92s - 1058.68s] People are usually not worried about the comments
[1058.68s - 1061.92s] that will come many years into being a creator.
[1061.92s - 1064.92s] It's the people around us that we're most worried about.
[1064.92s - 1068.60s] And so the only way we let go of that is recognizing
[1068.60s - 1071.00s] and building this identity and insight
[1071.00s - 1073.88s] that I can be a teacher and a creator.
[1073.88s - 1076.40s] I can be a nurse and a podcaster.
[1076.40s - 1079.44s] I can be a mom and own an online business.
[1079.44s - 1081.04s] I can be two things at once
[1081.04s - 1083.44s] and I don't need anyone else's permission.
[1083.44s - 1085.52s] And by the way, when I pull it off,
[1085.52s - 1087.44s] even then they won't understand.
[1087.44s - 1089.20s] So it was never about them understanding.
[1089.20s - 1091.56s] It was always about me focusing on what I love.
[1092.68s - 1095.56s] You know, I know that I've had like so many career changes.
[1095.56s - 1098.96s] I sometimes feel like I'm a cover band for ABBA
[1098.96s - 1100.28s] doing costume changes.
[1100.28s - 1101.44s] Like it's not a resume.
[1101.44s - 1103.40s] It's like a chooser on adventure.
[1103.40s - 1106.68s] But you have had so many twists and turns in your career.
[1106.68s - 1108.72s] You literally went from university
[1108.72s - 1111.04s] to a massive like consulting job
[1111.04s - 1114.76s] to pursuing like spiritual training as a monk
[1114.76s - 1116.96s] to then deciding having an epiphany.
[1116.96s - 1120.28s] And at every one of those moments,
[1120.28s - 1124.44s] there was that pressure that you're talking about
[1124.44s - 1128.28s] where you have to make a call that who you are
[1128.28s - 1131.56s] and how you're living your life no longer feels right.
[1131.56s - 1135.76s] And then you, but you have always made the turn.
[1135.76s - 1138.96s] And so can you just like quickly kind of tell us
[1138.96s - 1140.08s] a few of those moments
[1140.08s - 1142.88s] so that the person listening understands
[1142.88s - 1144.32s] that at any single moment,
[1144.32s - 1147.52s] you are literally one decision away
[1147.52s - 1150.64s] from turning your life in a different direction
[1150.64s - 1154.12s] and talk a little bit about what holds you back
[1154.12s - 1155.80s] when that resistance shows up.
[1155.80s - 1158.32s] Like, well, I can't leave a consulting job.
[1158.32s - 1159.48s] Thank you for saying that.
[1159.48s - 1164.48s] And the idea is everyone needs to become a professional quitter.
[1164.48s - 1167.90s] Right? It's like we need to get really good at quitting.
[1167.90s - 1171.68s] And as I'm listening to you, I'm thinking back to,
[1171.68s - 1175.60s] I remember when I decided to become a monk,
[1175.60s - 1178.50s] pretty much no one around me understood why.
[1178.50s - 1181.80s] I remember when I decided to leave the monastery,
[1181.80s - 1185.39s] pretty much everyone around me didn't understand why.
[1185.39s - 1187.79s] When I decided to get a job in consulting
[1187.79s - 1191.94s] after being a monk, people were like, why?
[1191.94s - 1195.14s] When I decided to leave my successful consulting job
[1195.14s - 1197.54s] to try and make videos online,
[1197.54s - 1199.82s] people were like, why are you doing that?
[1199.82s - 1202.26s] Then when those videos became successful
[1202.26s - 1205.22s] and I decided to launch a podcast,
[1205.22s - 1209.78s] I had three podcast production companies tell me,
[1209.78s - 1211.78s] Jay, people like listening to you for four minutes.
[1211.78s - 1213.62s] No one wants to listen to you for an hour.
[1213.62s - 1215.26s] Don't launch a podcast.
[1215.26s - 1216.94s] So we launched a podcast anyway.
[1216.94s - 1218.94s] And thanks to the millions of people that listen to you,
[1218.94s - 1221.58s] that listen to us, that know us, that became a success.
[1221.58s - 1225.62s] So I always listen to people, not the executives in the room.
[1225.62s - 1227.86s] Then I wanted to launch a book, Mel,
[1227.86s - 1229.38s] and I went to launch a book
[1229.38s - 1232.26s] and 14 out of 17 imprints told me,
[1232.26s - 1234.14s] don't call it think like a monk
[1234.14s - 1236.50s] because no one wants to think like a monk.
[1236.50s - 1238.42s] Five years later, the books sold millions of copies.
[1238.42s - 1242.88s] Again, thanks to those people, not the people in the room.
[1242.88s - 1244.24s] Why am I sharing all of that?
[1244.24s - 1247.92s] Because I didn't know what the future held.
[1247.92s - 1250.04s] It's not that I had a really clear view
[1250.04s - 1252.16s] of exactly where I was going or that
[1252.16s - 1254.40s] when I left the monastery, I knew I'd be here today
[1254.40s - 1256.72s] or that when we launched a podcast, I knew I'd be here.
[1256.72s - 1258.92s] And I want to get that thought out of people's heads,
[1258.92s - 1261.92s] that if I don't have the full life mapped out
[1261.92s - 1264.80s] and planned out that I can't take the first step,
[1264.80s - 1267.28s] because I don't think I've ever known where my life's going.
[1267.28s - 1268.28s] And so this whole idea
[1268.28s - 1270.00s] that you have to have everything figured out
[1270.00s - 1271.88s] before you take your first step
[1271.88s - 1273.64s] is the biggest lie we've been told.
[1273.64s - 1275.92s] This idea that if you don't have a clear vision,
[1275.92s - 1277.28s] you don't know where you're going.
[1277.28s - 1279.00s] It's the biggest lie we've been told.
[1279.00s - 1283.20s] How could anyone possibly have every step mapped out?
[1283.20s - 1285.84s] Tell me one person that we know in the world,
[1285.84s - 1287.80s] anyone you look up to that could tell you
[1287.80s - 1291.08s] they meticulously knew every single step they didn't.
[1291.08s - 1292.40s] But they took that first step.
[1292.40s - 1294.04s] And I think that's what's holding us back
[1294.04s - 1296.56s] is this idea that I have to know everything
[1296.56s - 1298.64s] before I do one thing.
[1298.64s - 1299.68s] What is the one thing though?
[1299.68s - 1301.84s] Because I think that's the thing that's confounding
[1301.84s - 1304.28s] until you actually figure out the riddle in life.
[1304.28s - 1305.20s] Yeah. Right?
[1305.20s - 1306.04s] Yeah.
[1306.04s - 1307.56s] It's sort of like you can't explain to somebody
[1307.56s - 1309.96s] what it feels like to be married
[1309.96s - 1312.08s] until you've done it.
[1312.08s - 1312.92s] Yes.
[1312.92s - 1317.08s] You can't explain to somebody how shockingly
[1317.08s - 1318.96s] simple things can be
[1318.96s - 1322.32s] until you've learned how to push through your own resistance
[1322.32s - 1324.40s] to the things that you're interested in
[1324.40s - 1327.20s] and curious about experimenting with or trying.
[1327.20s - 1330.12s] And so for somebody that's never even considered
[1330.12s - 1333.08s] a possibility for themselves beyond consulting
[1333.08s - 1335.36s] or beyond where they're at right now
[1335.36s - 1337.56s] or beyond the major that they had
[1337.56s - 1340.14s] or beyond the city that they live in,
[1340.14s - 1341.66s] what is that first step?
[1341.66s - 1346.06s] And is there a way if you're not even in touch
[1346.06s - 1349.38s] with what it feels like to be pulled towards something new
[1349.38s - 1351.34s] to identify it in yourself?
[1351.34s - 1352.66s] Because I think that's one of the things
[1352.66s - 1353.90s] that you do for people.
[1353.90s - 1357.58s] You help people see a bigger possibility for themselves.
[1357.58s - 1360.34s] And it took me a long time
[1360.34s - 1364.06s] to go from simply surviving and trying to pay bills
[1364.06s - 1365.70s] and get through the day
[1365.70s - 1370.70s] to understanding that there's a different way to wake up
[1371.42s - 1374.26s] and be tapped into the signals
[1374.26s - 1377.02s] and the energetic things that pull you
[1377.02s - 1378.70s] in different directions.
[1378.70s - 1380.66s] Because I think that's what you're talking about
[1380.66s - 1383.90s] when you say all you need to do is take one step.
[1383.90s - 1385.19s] Yes.
[1385.19s - 1388.39s] The step I'd say in the most practical way
[1388.39s - 1390.43s] to make it really, really simple for people
[1390.43s - 1393.71s] and get away from any philosophical idea
[1393.71s - 1397.23s] is it's actually not about falling in love
[1397.23s - 1400.43s] with something new or finding something else.
[1400.43s - 1402.99s] It's about extracting and learning
[1402.99s - 1406.27s] every possible thing from where you are right now.
[1406.27s - 1407.51s] Whatever job you're in.
[1407.51s - 1408.51s] But I don't want to do that, Jay,
[1408.51s - 1409.51s] because I hate my bad day.
[1409.51s - 1411.47s] But that is the thing.
[1411.47s - 1412.95s] You can hate where you're at.
[1412.95s - 1413.79s] Yes.
[1413.79s - 1417.67s] And still gain all the skills you need for your future.
[1417.67s - 1418.79s] When I was a consultant,
[1418.79s - 1420.43s] I knew I did not want to be a consultant
[1420.43s - 1421.47s] for the rest of my life.
[1421.47s - 1424.79s] But I learned so many incredible skills from consulting
[1424.79s - 1426.67s] that are so useful today.
[1426.67s - 1429.03s] Whether it's negotiation, whether it's communication,
[1429.03s - 1430.47s] whether it's presentation,
[1430.47s - 1432.19s] whether it's connecting with clients,
[1432.19s - 1434.27s] whatever it may be, there were so many skills.
[1434.27s - 1436.11s] If you're working in a school, I promise you,
[1436.11s - 1438.51s] there are so many skills in that school
[1438.51s - 1440.83s] that are available that if you start learning,
[1440.83s - 1442.91s] all of a sudden that place you hate
[1442.91s - 1444.79s] becomes a place that becomes a stepping stone
[1444.79s - 1445.79s] for your next step.
[1445.79s - 1447.95s] So is there a mindset shift?
[1447.95s - 1449.63s] Like from, I hate this dread,
[1449.63s - 1451.71s] like there've been times in my life
[1451.71s - 1454.39s] where I literally, you're heading to work.
[1454.39s - 1457.79s] You're just like, I do not want to walk through the door
[1457.79s - 1460.51s] and actually have to be there today.
[1460.51s - 1462.87s] So is there a mindset shift
[1462.87s - 1467.19s] that you would advise us to just hold onto?
[1467.19s - 1468.03s] Yes.
[1468.03s - 1472.35s] Because it shifts the experience of being where you are.
[1472.35s - 1474.07s] What is that mindset shift?
[1474.07s - 1476.71s] If you're going to spend eight to nine hours,
[1476.71s - 1479.71s] maybe more at work every day,
[1479.71s - 1481.43s] it's not great to walk in
[1481.43s - 1482.99s] and think that for nine hours a day,
[1482.99s - 1485.95s] your mind is programming your thoughts
[1485.95s - 1487.55s] to say, I hate being here.
[1487.55s - 1488.67s] I don't want to be here.
[1488.67s - 1489.95s] I can't wait to get out
[1489.95s - 1492.71s] because you've wasted nine hours of your day
[1492.71s - 1494.83s] that could be used in building the next thing.
[1494.83s - 1498.11s] So the mindset shift is, I do hate being here.
[1498.11s - 1499.19s] I'm going to accept that.
[1499.19s - 1500.23s] I'm going to acknowledge that.
[1500.23s - 1501.99s] I'm not going to lie to myself,
[1501.99s - 1505.47s] but I'm going to take everything I possibly can
[1505.47s - 1509.83s] from this opportunity because it is a part of my story.
[1509.83s - 1512.27s] And it is such a powerful part of my story
[1512.27s - 1514.43s] because this only makes the story better.
[1514.43s - 1516.67s] I'm going to learn from a place that I hate
[1516.67s - 1519.91s] and I'm going to learn everything I possibly can.
[1519.91s - 1521.63s] And so that mindset shift is,
[1521.63s - 1526.35s] how do I turn and transform a place of misery and pain
[1526.35s - 1529.03s] and potentially suffering into a place
[1529.03s - 1530.99s] that becomes the launch pad of my life?
[1530.99s - 1532.95s] And all of a sudden now you're walking into work
[1532.95s - 1535.51s] thinking, oh, this is a launch pad.
[1535.51s - 1537.03s] Oh, wait a minute, this is a step.
[1537.03s - 1539.91s] This is the place where I take off from
[1539.91s - 1541.51s] rather than, oh, this is a place
[1541.51s - 1543.31s] that's keeping me in prison.
[1543.31s - 1545.75s] And I think that's the switch that people need to make
[1545.75s - 1548.79s] because if you're always looking for it outside of work,
[1548.79s - 1550.87s] you're only giving yourself two hours in the evening,
[1550.87s - 1553.47s] maybe an hour if you're lucky after you've done the chores,
[1553.47s - 1555.71s] put the kids to bed, wash the dishes.
[1555.71s - 1557.83s] So why not use those eight to nine hours
[1557.83s - 1559.47s] to build skills, to build confidence,
[1559.47s - 1562.19s] to build security that you have available to you?
[1562.19s - 1563.75s] Well, you know what else I hear?
[1563.75s - 1564.59s] I hear trust.
[1564.59s - 1565.43s] Yes.
[1565.43s - 1567.99s] Because I think a lot of times, at least me personally,
[1567.99s - 1570.51s] when I've felt very stuck,
[1570.51s - 1574.51s] there was this intense feeling like I was in the wrong place,
[1574.51s - 1576.51s] which then creates resistance.
[1576.51s - 1580.43s] And what you just did is by saying,
[1580.43s - 1582.19s] if I'm going to spend eight hours here,
[1582.19s - 1583.71s] then I'm going to get everything I can out of it
[1583.71s - 1587.19s] because I trust that by doing that,
[1587.19s - 1589.95s] I'll actually find the next thing.
[1589.95s - 1592.23s] There's a beautiful book which talks
[1592.23s - 1597.07s] about how really we find our purpose through sampling.
[1597.07s - 1598.43s] And when I think of the word sampling,
[1598.43s - 1603.11s] the way I describe it as is collecting and connecting.
[1603.11s - 1606.91s] You are collecting stories, experiences,
[1606.91s - 1611.63s] skills and ideas in every job you work in.
[1611.63s - 1615.67s] And one day, after collecting for many, many years,
[1615.67s - 1620.07s] you will connect the dots of all of those different skills,
[1620.07s - 1622.39s] of all of those different experiences.
[1622.39s - 1624.63s] And that's when everything falls into place.
[1624.63s - 1626.71s] But if you don't collect in the first place,
[1626.71s - 1628.19s] there's nothing to connect.
[1628.19s - 1630.71s] It's not about finding and discovering something.
[1630.71s - 1632.27s] It's collecting along the way.
[1632.27s - 1633.99s] You're collecting little jigsaw pieces.
[1633.99s - 1636.19s] And then one day you spread them out and you put them down
[1636.19s - 1638.31s] and you start putting the pieces out and they all fit.
[1638.31s - 1640.63s] And you go, oh my gosh, I can't believe they connected.
[1640.63s - 1642.31s] When I look back in my life and I think,
[1642.31s - 1645.27s] I'm as much a consultant as I am among,
[1645.27s - 1647.11s] as I am a media person,
[1647.11s - 1649.35s] all of those things are really valuable parts of me.
[1649.35s - 1651.31s] And it goes back to the point I was making earlier,
[1651.31s - 1653.35s] I can't be a nurse and a content creator.
[1653.35s - 1654.63s] I can't be this and that.
[1654.63s - 1657.43s] Well, you can because that is your superpower.
[1657.43s - 1659.91s] Your superpower is that you did what you did
[1659.91s - 1660.99s] in the past and what you do now.
[1661.07s - 1662.75s] And by the way, you already are those things.
[1662.75s - 1664.63s] You already are those things, whether you like it or not.
[1664.63s - 1668.58s] And maybe that's the whole point,
[1668.58s - 1670.26s] that you already are those things,
[1670.26s - 1672.14s] which is why you feel haunted
[1672.14s - 1676.86s] when you are in a chapter in your life that is over
[1676.86s - 1679.70s] and it's time for you to move toward the next thing
[1679.70s - 1680.98s] that's already a part of you.
[1680.98s - 1682.94s] And the reason why you know it's already a part of you
[1682.94s - 1684.74s] is because you actually feel pulled
[1684.74s - 1688.02s] to make YouTube videos or pulled to go back to graduate school
[1688.02s - 1691.42s] or pulled to be in a different relationship.
[1691.42s - 1694.66s] And I think this all goes back to college and school
[1694.66s - 1696.86s] in the sense that we were all forced to think
[1696.86s - 1698.54s] you had to pick one thing.
[1698.54s - 1700.38s] Your whole life, you were trained to say,
[1700.38s - 1701.98s] I've got to pick one thing
[1701.98s - 1703.78s] that I've got to do for the rest of my life.
[1703.78s - 1705.14s] That's how you were trained.
[1705.14s - 1707.78s] So when you were young, you start narrowing down your subjects,
[1707.78s - 1709.54s] you get to college, you pick a major,
[1709.54s - 1710.74s] you focus in on one thing
[1710.74s - 1712.66s] and you think you have to do that for the rest of your life.
[1712.66s - 1714.38s] And then you start doing it for three years
[1714.38s - 1716.14s] and then three years into a new job,
[1716.14s - 1718.50s] you go, I don't want to do this anymore.
[1718.50s - 1719.98s] This isn't what it was meant to be.
[1719.98s - 1721.10s] But your whole life, you were told,
[1721.10s - 1722.90s] you could only be one thing.
[1722.90s - 1724.98s] You had to pick one thing to focus on.
[1724.98s - 1727.14s] So that's why we're so obsessed with this idea
[1727.14s - 1730.06s] that my title should have to be one thing.
[1730.06s - 1731.78s] I should be able to say, I'm a lawyer, I'm an accountant,
[1731.78s - 1734.42s] I'm a doctor, I'm a nurse, I'm a teacher, I'm a mom,
[1734.42s - 1737.02s] whatever it is, but I can't be three things.
[1737.02s - 1738.14s] That's complicated.
[1738.14s - 1741.22s] But we've been forced to believe that you are that title.
[1741.22s - 1743.10s] You are a manager, or by the way,
[1743.10s - 1745.50s] senior manager and you feel better about it
[1745.50s - 1747.98s] or executive and you made to feel better about it,
[1747.98s - 1749.46s] but you're only allowed to be that.
[1749.46s - 1751.06s] You can't then be anything else.
[1751.06s - 1753.62s] And so I love it when I see people in their Instagram bios
[1753.62s - 1755.50s] and people are like, I'm a mom first,
[1755.50s - 1756.70s] but I'm an executive second.
[1756.70s - 1758.74s] I'm a this, I love it that people are playing
[1758.74s - 1761.50s] with that idea because that's the permission we need.
[1762.46s - 1767.46s] So Jay, what is the difference between purpose and passion?
[1767.86s - 1770.50s] And what do we get wrong about it?
[1770.50s - 1772.90s] Passion is what brings you life.
[1772.90s - 1774.30s] It's what brings you joy.
[1774.30s - 1778.86s] It's what makes you feel like you're doing something exciting
[1778.86s - 1780.38s] and exhilarating and thrilling.
[1780.38s - 1783.58s] So for me, it's studying and learning and synthesizing.
[1783.58s - 1786.82s] I could spend a weekend in a cave of books
[1786.82s - 1789.18s] and never get out and make notes and study.
[1789.18s - 1792.12s] That's one of my greatest passions in life.
[1792.12s - 1795.36s] Your purpose is when you use your passion
[1795.36s - 1797.20s] in the service of others.
[1797.20s - 1800.56s] If your passion doesn't have a service element,
[1800.56s - 1803.20s] if you don't use it to improve people's lives,
[1803.20s - 1805.48s] if you don't use it to inform other people,
[1805.48s - 1808.36s] if you don't use it to make a difference in someone's life,
[1808.36s - 1809.84s] it's not a purpose.
[1809.84s - 1811.28s] So let me give an example.
[1811.28s - 1813.08s] If you're a photographer
[1813.08s - 1815.60s] and your favorite passion in the world is photography,
[1815.60s - 1817.72s] you love finding unique locations,
[1817.72s - 1819.72s] you love capturing human emotion,
[1819.72s - 1822.20s] you love capturing memories for people.
[1822.20s - 1825.08s] As soon as you start doing it for others, it's a purpose.
[1825.08s - 1826.76s] There you have it, it's that simple.
[1826.76s - 1829.40s] It's not like you have to go on a whole charity trail
[1829.40s - 1831.64s] and start taking pictures and giving them out for free.
[1831.64s - 1833.04s] When you start capturing moments
[1833.04s - 1836.04s] and you do it with that intent, it's a service.
[1836.04s - 1837.68s] There's a beautiful study that I love
[1837.68s - 1839.92s] from Amy Vrasniewski and their team
[1839.92s - 1841.88s] at the Yale School of Management.
[1841.88s - 1845.92s] So they went out in 2019 to research
[1845.92s - 1849.92s] what they believed was the most difficult job in America.
[1849.92s - 1850.96s] Any guesses, Mel?
[1853.30s - 1855.50s] Psychologically or physically?
[1855.50s - 1857.54s] Well, they just went out to think
[1857.54s - 1858.38s] what was the most difficult job.
[1858.38s - 1859.62s] Well, I think probably a teacher.
[1859.62s - 1861.14s] Yeah, that was up there.
[1861.14s - 1862.50s] Or a public servant, I don't know.
[1862.50s - 1864.82s] All up there, the one that they decided on
[1864.82s - 1866.74s] was hospital cleaner.
[1866.74s - 1868.18s] Because they believe that these people
[1868.18s - 1872.54s] not only have to wash bed sheets, pillows, floors, toilets,
[1872.54s - 1875.78s] plates, they have to wash up after people pass away.
[1875.78s - 1876.86s] So it's a very heavy job.
[1876.86s - 1879.14s] And also, you just finished cleaning a toilet,
[1879.14s - 1881.54s] you leave and now you gotta run in and clean it again.
[1881.54s - 1883.90s] It's not as simple as, hey, we did that once
[1883.90s - 1885.34s] and it doesn't happen anymore.
[1885.34s - 1887.98s] So they went and interviewed these hospital cleaners
[1887.98s - 1889.66s] and they asked them what they did.
[1889.66s - 1891.50s] And the hospital cleaners said,
[1891.50s - 1894.62s] we believe we're low skilled labor in their own words.
[1894.62s - 1896.78s] We wash toilets, plates, floors.
[1896.78s - 1899.50s] They carried on and they found this whole group
[1899.50s - 1903.14s] of hospital cleaners who didn't call themselves cleaners.
[1903.14s - 1907.06s] They called themselves healers and carers.
[1907.06s - 1911.78s] These healers worked the exact same hours as the cleaners.
[1911.78s - 1914.22s] They worked the same shifts.
[1914.22s - 1915.94s] They worked the same hospitals.
[1915.94s - 1917.58s] They got paid the same amount,
[1917.58s - 1920.94s] but they were happier, more purposeful and more productive.
[1920.94s - 1923.94s] So they asked them, why do you call yourself healers?
[1923.94s - 1927.46s] They said, and this blew my mind, like every time I think
[1927.46s - 1929.78s] about this, it really makes me emotional
[1929.78s - 1931.18s] because it's so powerful.
[1931.18s - 1936.28s] They said, we believe that a clean hospital is integral
[1937.40s - 1939.76s] to the healing journey of a patient.
[1939.76s - 1942.48s] We think that when the hospital is clean,
[1942.48s - 1946.56s] people have more dignity at a time of difficulty.
[1946.56s - 1949.62s] We believe that when the hospital is clean,
[1949.62s - 1953.42s] that people's families will spend more time with them,
[1953.42s - 1955.66s] they'll actually surround their bedside
[1955.66s - 1957.74s] because it feels like a clean atmosphere
[1957.74s - 1959.87s] in their time of need.
[1959.87s - 1964.63s] They said, we believe that a clean hospital is part of healing.
[1964.63s - 1967.89s] So how could we see ourselves as anything else?
[1967.89s - 1970.77s] What I love about that now is that Amy
[1970.77s - 1974.33s] of his new scanner team came up with a term called job crafting,
[1974.33s - 1978.70s] which means it's not what you do every day.
[1978.70s - 1981.58s] It's how you feel about what you do every day.
[1981.58s - 1983.54s] That changes the experience of it.
[1983.54s - 1984.74s] It's not just what you do.
[1984.74s - 1986.06s] It's not even why you do it.
[1986.06s - 1988.14s] It's how you feel about it.
[1988.14s - 1990.26s] How do you feel about what you do?
[1990.26s - 1993.90s] They all felt that what they did was critical to healing
[1993.90s - 1996.06s] and it transformed their experience.
[1996.06s - 1997.98s] And there's this beautiful quote from Wayne Dyer
[1997.98s - 2000.14s] that I loved where he said,
[2000.14s - 2002.74s] when you change the way you look at things,
[2002.74s - 2005.30s] the things you look at change.
[2005.30s - 2007.98s] And I really believe that that's what we're all being called
[2007.98s - 2009.02s] to do right now.
[2009.02s - 2010.58s] When you're feeling stuck,
[2010.58s - 2012.98s] you might not be able to change what's around you.
[2012.98s - 2014.74s] So change how you view it,
[2014.74s - 2016.22s] change how you look at it,
[2016.22s - 2017.22s] because all of a sudden,
[2017.22s - 2020.02s] everything starts to change in your favor.
[2020.02s - 2022.34s] That is the single best definition
[2022.34s - 2024.11s] of purpose I've ever heard.
[2024.11s - 2026.11s] And it's accessible.
[2026.11s - 2028.79s] And I wanna make sure that as you're listening to Jay
[2028.79s - 2030.51s] and you're spending time together with us
[2030.51s - 2033.71s] that you really take away that definition.
[2033.71s - 2035.51s] Because it's even when you're stuck
[2035.51s - 2038.47s] or even when you've just got a lot going on,
[2038.47s - 2042.39s] it's very easy to identify the little things in your life
[2042.39s - 2043.63s] that energize you,
[2043.63s - 2046.15s] whether it's books like Jay or for me,
[2046.15s - 2049.31s] I love gardening and flowers and I love cooking.
[2049.31s - 2051.91s] I love spending time with my family.
[2051.91s - 2053.23s] I love making people smart.
[2053.23s - 2054.83s] That brings me energy, right?
[2054.83s - 2055.91s] I love being outside.
[2055.91s - 2057.23s] I love learning.
[2057.23s - 2060.27s] And so when you take those things
[2060.27s - 2062.11s] that naturally bring you energy
[2062.11s - 2064.79s] and you do a little bit more of it, it lifts you up.
[2064.79s - 2066.95s] But then when you figure out ways
[2066.95s - 2070.39s] to extend those things that bring you energy
[2070.39s - 2073.03s] in service of others,
[2073.03s - 2075.95s] now you're on the track of discovering
[2075.95s - 2078.19s] why you're here in the first place
[2078.19s - 2079.87s] and aligning your life with purpose.
[2079.87s - 2083.38s] And so in that beautiful example you just gave
[2083.38s - 2086.30s] and thinking about it energizes people
[2086.30s - 2089.30s] to be like part of something
[2089.30s - 2090.86s] where you're caring for people.
[2090.86s - 2092.26s] Even in the hardest job in the world,
[2092.26s - 2093.94s] that's why I use that example.
[2093.94s - 2096.42s] Because those individuals may not even be passionate
[2096.42s - 2098.06s] about cleaning,
[2098.06s - 2100.62s] but they've found a way to think about it differently.
[2100.62s - 2102.46s] That's why it touches my heart so much
[2102.46s - 2105.58s] because it's in such a difficult space and environment.
[2105.58s - 2107.42s] And to your point, Mel, what you were just saying,
[2107.42s - 2111.38s] I was talking to one of my team about this
[2111.38s - 2114.30s] and she was talking to me about how her mom
[2114.30s - 2116.58s] didn't really know what her purpose was.
[2116.58s - 2118.30s] So I asked her, what's her passion?
[2118.30s - 2120.10s] And she said her favorite thing
[2120.10s - 2122.82s] is to organize family trips.
[2122.82s - 2126.74s] And so now her mom has started organizing family trips
[2126.74s - 2129.98s] for not only her family, but the friends of her family
[2129.98s - 2130.82s] and couples.
[2130.82s - 2134.22s] And so she's a retired mom at this point in her life,
[2134.22s - 2135.86s] but she loves planning trips.
[2135.86s - 2138.58s] She lives vicariously through all of her kids
[2138.58s - 2141.06s] and their friends and grandkids and whoever else it is.
[2141.06s - 2142.34s] And that's what she does now.
[2142.34s - 2143.62s] That's a purpose.
[2143.62s - 2145.90s] Your purpose doesn't need to be this big thing
[2145.90s - 2148.50s] that you have to go and change a million people's lives
[2148.50s - 2149.42s] or a billion people's lives.
[2149.42s - 2151.18s] If you can do that, that's beautiful.
[2151.18s - 2152.38s] But that's not what a purpose is.
[2152.38s - 2155.26s] Your purpose is not defined by scale.
[2155.26s - 2158.22s] It's not defined by the amount of people you reach.
[2158.22s - 2160.34s] It's not defined by doing something big.
[2160.34s - 2162.46s] Your purpose doesn't have to be your job.
[2162.46s - 2165.30s] It doesn't have to be something you dream of doing every day.
[2165.30s - 2167.86s] Your purpose is simply using your passion
[2167.86s - 2170.50s] in the service of others in the smallest of ways,
[2170.50s - 2172.02s] in the simplest of ways.
[2172.02s - 2173.70s] And it brings you so much joy.
[2173.70s - 2177.50s] And by the way, it also gives you validation
[2177.50s - 2179.10s] for something beautiful that you do.
[2179.10s - 2180.34s] We all want validation.
[2180.34s - 2181.54s] We all seek it.
[2181.54s - 2182.98s] And I want to just normalize that
[2182.98s - 2185.74s] because I think people feel bad for wanting it.
[2185.74s - 2187.98s] But we all need to feel wanted and needed
[2187.98s - 2188.86s] and loved.
[2188.86s - 2190.58s] It's part of being human.
[2190.58s - 2194.46s] But the problem is when you become someone you don't want to be
[2194.46s - 2197.34s] or do something you don't want to do to get validation.
[2197.34s - 2199.50s] Whereas when you get validated for using your passion
[2199.50s - 2201.14s] in the service of others,
[2201.14s - 2203.34s] there's no greater feeling than that.
[2203.34s - 2204.54s] You know, I want to give an example
[2204.54s - 2206.94s] because I feel like one of the mistakes
[2206.94s - 2208.42s] that I made for a long time
[2208.42s - 2211.30s] when it came to, quote, discovering my purpose
[2211.30s - 2213.62s] is that I thought it was one thing.
[2213.62s - 2217.10s] And it's actually everything.
[2217.10s - 2217.94s] Yes.
[2217.94s - 2219.70s] And so when we moved to Southern Vermont
[2219.70s - 2222.86s] and I remember feeling very stuck and in a new chapter
[2222.86s - 2226.66s] and isolated and needing to like meet all new friends
[2226.66s - 2228.10s] and build community,
[2228.10s - 2232.18s] that I learned of this flower farmer
[2232.18s - 2236.74s] and her flowers were, it was near the end of the summer
[2236.74s - 2239.26s] and into fall and Frost was coming and it's dahlias.
[2239.26s - 2240.86s] And you need to dig them up.
[2240.86s - 2243.30s] I know I'm getting really geeky on the flowers.
[2243.30s - 2245.34s] And the frost was starting to hit
[2245.34s - 2247.22s] and it was an entire field.
[2247.22s - 2248.38s] And they were all going to die.
[2248.38s - 2251.22s] And I felt this like ache because flowers
[2251.22s - 2252.74s] bring me energy.
[2254.30s - 2258.74s] I tracked down the person who was growing the flowers
[2258.74s - 2262.02s] and found out that they had had a health issue.
[2262.02s - 2264.14s] And so I organized a bunch of women
[2264.14s - 2269.14s] that I had recently met to help this person dig up the tubers.
[2270.14s - 2274.22s] That is an example that has nothing to do with career.
[2274.22s - 2277.42s] It has nothing to do with my life's mission
[2277.42s - 2279.58s] and all the things I do for work.
[2279.58s - 2284.10s] It is a small example of how I took something
[2284.10s - 2288.94s] that energized me and use that energy
[2288.94s - 2293.34s] that's authentic to me in service of someone else.
[2293.34s - 2298.50s] And that small example is an example
[2298.50s - 2301.06s] of how you can infuse a sense of purpose
[2301.06s - 2304.58s] in your day-to-day life in really small
[2304.58s - 2306.82s] but deeply meaningful important ways.
[2306.82s - 2308.66s] Yes, yes, I love that.
[2308.66s - 2310.02s] And it's so true.
[2310.02s - 2311.66s] I'm thinking about Radi when Radi first
[2311.66s - 2313.30s] moved with me to America,
[2313.30s - 2315.50s] she couldn't work here because she was on a spouse visa
[2315.50s - 2317.82s] and until we all got all that sorted out.
[2317.82s - 2321.30s] And Radi wasn't always the writer
[2321.30s - 2322.78s] of a New York Times best-selling cookbook.
[2322.78s - 2326.70s] Like that's a very like recent iteration of her life.
[2326.74s - 2328.30s] Well, when we became friends, Jay,
[2328.30s - 2332.30s] so you know, like you and I have been friends for a long time
[2332.30s - 2336.26s] and we are extremely supportive and fond of one another,
[2336.26s - 2337.98s] our spouses know each other.
[2337.98s - 2339.66s] But when I first met you and Radi,
[2339.66s - 2342.98s] she had not launched this part of her life.
[2342.98s - 2345.50s] Absolutely, no social media, no content.
[2345.50s - 2346.58s] Yeah, exactly.
[2346.58s - 2348.66s] And so obviously we remember her like that.
[2348.66s - 2350.18s] She isn't like that to the world now
[2350.18s - 2353.70s] but I remember when we moved to LA,
[2353.70s - 2355.70s] Radi would just be really sad
[2355.70s - 2358.94s] when we'd be driving around and see the homeless situation.
[2358.94s - 2360.98s] And she always loved cooking.
[2360.98s - 2362.26s] Like she was always a fan of cooking
[2362.26s - 2364.62s] since I've known her, she's been an amazing cook.
[2364.62s - 2366.54s] She would literally just cook and deliver meals.
[2366.54s - 2369.34s] She'd get involved in food distribution programs in the area.
[2369.34s - 2371.06s] She'd go and find out and talk to communities
[2371.06s - 2372.54s] of how she could help.
[2372.54s - 2374.26s] Before she made any content,
[2374.26s - 2376.26s] she was just out there doing that.
[2376.26s - 2378.62s] And that's what built her confidence
[2378.62s - 2380.50s] in being able to do it and being able to deliver.
[2380.50s - 2382.06s] And then even when someone said to her,
[2382.06s - 2383.06s] hey, would you cater?
[2383.06s - 2385.50s] She said, I don't want to do it as catering.
[2385.50s - 2388.70s] She loves cooking as an act of lovers and an act of service.
[2388.70s - 2390.78s] If you come over, she'd want to cook for you
[2390.78s - 2392.86s] because you're a friend, that's what she enjoys.
[2392.86s - 2394.30s] She wants to cook for people in need,
[2394.30s - 2396.62s] that's what she gets passion from.
[2396.62s - 2397.78s] She doesn't actually want to be said,
[2397.78s - 2399.66s] hey, can you make 20 meals of this?
[2399.66s - 2402.22s] That's not actually what brings her joy.
[2402.22s - 2404.94s] And so you can see how your purpose
[2404.94s - 2406.62s] doesn't have to be your job.
[2406.62s - 2408.62s] Your purpose doesn't have to be big.
[2408.62s - 2410.90s] Your purpose doesn't have to get you followers.
[2410.90s - 2413.42s] Your purpose doesn't need to have social media.
[2413.42s - 2415.22s] It doesn't need to have any of those things.
[2415.22s - 2417.90s] And actually, if you start without all of those things,
[2417.90s - 2422.34s] you'll build more confidence, more self-worth and more joy
[2422.34s - 2424.18s] that then if you want to do any of those things,
[2424.18s - 2425.58s] they'll happen naturally.
[2425.58s - 2429.74s] They'll come as a byproduct of that infectious energy you feel
[2429.74s - 2430.98s] and that I've seen rather you feel.
[2430.98s - 2434.26s] Well, I want to come back to two themes and highlight it.
[2434.26s - 2436.30s] You know, one of the things that you said is it's not about
[2436.30s - 2439.10s] imagining the thing out there.
[2439.10s - 2442.22s] It's about really stopping and listening
[2442.22s - 2445.78s] and reflecting on what Jay is sharing with you
[2445.78s - 2447.82s] about the fact that there's something
[2447.82s - 2450.10s] that's already bringing you energy,
[2450.10s - 2454.82s] that when you do it, it just brings something out in you
[2454.82s - 2457.46s] and then finding ways to do it in service of others.
[2457.46s - 2460.14s] So if you take the example of your wife,
[2460.14s - 2463.82s] she's focused on cooking as an act of love.
[2463.82s - 2465.54s] It's always been a creative expression.
[2465.54s - 2467.98s] It naturally energizes her.
[2467.98s - 2471.18s] And so she used that to lift herself up
[2471.26s - 2472.46s] in a new chapter of her life.
[2472.46s - 2475.78s] She found a way to be of service.
[2475.78s - 2479.57s] And the amazing thing about life
[2479.57s - 2481.41s] is that when you align yourself
[2481.41s - 2483.97s] with the things that naturally energize you
[2483.97s - 2486.61s] and you, let's come to a second thing we've talked about, Jay,
[2486.61s - 2489.81s] trust that where you are
[2489.81s - 2495.53s] is somehow in service of where you're meant to go.
[2495.53s - 2499.93s] Follow the energy and follow how you serve others
[2499.93s - 2501.89s] in sharing that energy.
[2501.89s - 2506.73s] And that is how you actually start walking in the path
[2506.73s - 2507.89s] that is meant for you.
[2507.89s - 2510.18s] And I just wanna point out
[2510.18s - 2512.74s] that not only is she in New York Times
[2512.74s - 2514.90s] best-selling cookbook author,
[2514.90s - 2519.26s] but the name of the cookbook is Joy Full
[2519.26s - 2522.10s] as an F-U-L-L
[2522.10s - 2525.18s] because you're full of her fabulous vegan cooking.
[2525.18s - 2528.98s] And so she didn't start cooking
[2528.98s - 2531.02s] and serving people in LA
[2531.02s - 2533.50s] because she's like, I'm gonna write a cookbook one of these days.
[2533.50s - 2537.22s] Exactly. She did it to lift herself up
[2537.22s - 2540.66s] at a moment in her life where she was stuck
[2540.66s - 2542.70s] and where she was moving to a new place.
[2542.70s - 2545.70s] And so it's so important to understand
[2545.70s - 2548.22s] it's not the thing that you're imagining.
[2548.22s - 2549.70s] It's the energy in you
[2549.70s - 2552.26s] and it's the ability to shift your mindset
[2552.26s - 2554.90s] and trust that if you leverage that positive energy
[2554.90s - 2556.18s] and service of others,
[2556.18s - 2560.98s] it always, always, always points you where you're meant to go.
[2560.98s - 2563.70s] Yes. And people will say to us,
[2563.70s - 2565.70s] but I don't know what I like.
[2565.70s - 2567.06s] I don't know what gives me energy.
[2567.06s - 2568.30s] I hear that a lot today.
[2568.30s - 2569.14s] You do.
[2569.14s - 2570.66s] Yeah, but it's like people are just like,
[2570.66s - 2572.94s] I don't know what gives me energy anymore.
[2572.94s - 2573.78s] I'm kind of numb to it.
[2573.78s - 2576.50s] And I think the point is not to find this
[2576.50s - 2579.46s] big, bright light of energy from something.
[2579.46s - 2581.58s] It's this small, tiny voice.
[2581.58s - 2583.94s] It's been ignored for so long
[2583.94s - 2586.06s] that the way it shows up within us
[2586.06s - 2589.22s] isn't always this big, loud screen.
[2589.22s - 2591.30s] It's this quiet little whisper
[2591.30s - 2593.62s] that just says, try this, give it a go.
[2593.62s - 2595.02s] It's not this big calling.
[2595.02s - 2597.02s] I think we think about callings
[2597.02s - 2599.58s] and what we want to do is this big,
[2599.58s - 2602.18s] bright light of information and a sign.
[2602.18s - 2604.14s] Signs are small.
[2604.14s - 2604.98s] They're whispers.
[2604.98s - 2606.70s] They're quiet.
[2606.70s - 2608.82s] And I think if we just lean into that,
[2608.82s - 2611.14s] it may just be the little voice in your head that says,
[2611.14s - 2613.58s] you love organizing birthdays.
[2613.58s - 2614.46s] Why don't you just organize
[2614.46s - 2616.99s] a couple more birthday parties this year?
[2616.99s - 2618.79s] Oh, you're really good at event planning.
[2618.79s - 2620.95s] Why don't you help your friend with their wedding?
[2620.95s - 2621.79s] Oh, you know what?
[2621.79s - 2623.63s] You're really, really good at writing.
[2623.63s - 2626.23s] Why don't you just write a quote every day?
[2626.23s - 2627.79s] Right? It's that little voice.
[2627.79s - 2629.59s] So just follow the whisper.
[2629.59s - 2631.63s] Do you think that your life, if you look backwards,
[2631.63s - 2634.39s] also provides answers for what energizes you?
[2634.39s - 2637.63s] Because I think it's a very important point to validate
[2637.63s - 2640.15s] that we are at a moment in time
[2640.15s - 2642.07s] where the research bears out
[2642.07s - 2646.95s] that over 80% of us are living in a state of chronic stress.
[2646.95s - 2647.79s] Yes.
[2647.79s - 2652.79s] The feeling of being numb is very, very common right now
[2653.19s - 2655.99s] and probably a sign that you're actually mentally well
[2655.99s - 2658.47s] because there's so much chaos and overwhelm and stuff.
[2658.47s - 2661.59s] But so validating that,
[2661.59s - 2665.19s] and even if somebody turns inward and doesn't quite feel it,
[2665.19s - 2668.31s] are there other things that someone can do
[2668.31s - 2671.07s] that you would recommend to help access that
[2671.07s - 2672.43s] if you're just at a point where you just,
[2672.43s - 2674.83s] I am so spent, I don't even know myself anymore.
[2674.83s - 2677.51s] Yes. I promise you, and I really mean this,
[2677.51s - 2680.87s] and I want everyone to really internalize this, as I say it,
[2680.87s - 2684.27s] you are already successful at something.
[2684.27s - 2688.51s] It's just so easy to you that you don't think of as success.
[2688.51s - 2691.07s] There's something that comes effortlessly to you.
[2691.07s - 2693.63s] Maybe you graduated college with flying colors.
[2693.63s - 2697.31s] Maybe you take care of your kids in the best way possible.
[2697.31s - 2699.35s] Maybe you're just incredible
[2699.39s - 2701.47s] as showing up for your work colleagues.
[2701.47s - 2705.55s] You already are extremely, incredibly successful at something,
[2705.55s - 2708.79s] but because it's easy for you and natural for you,
[2708.79s - 2710.47s] you don't think it's a skill.
[2710.47s - 2715.07s] So look back at your life and look back at all the things
[2715.07s - 2716.15s] that you've done beautifully.
[2716.15s - 2718.11s] You showed up for your friends at college.
[2718.11s - 2720.19s] You helped your colleagues through a tough time.
[2720.19s - 2721.99s] You've already been doing that.
[2721.99s - 2723.71s] You just don't know what that looks like
[2723.71s - 2726.03s] because you think that's what a good person does.
[2726.03s - 2727.59s] And it is what a good person does.
[2727.59s - 2728.63s] But on top of that,
[2728.63s - 2731.63s] it is value that you've been adding all along the way.
[2731.63s - 2734.03s] Look at the clues, look at the footprints,
[2734.03s - 2737.39s] look at the steps behind and don't take the for granted.
[2737.39s - 2740.39s] Most likely the things that you don't value
[2740.39s - 2742.43s] because they're simple to you are the things
[2742.43s - 2744.07s] that the world is looking for.
[2744.07s - 2746.11s] Rather these cooking skill is something
[2746.11s - 2747.39s] that comes really naturally to her.
[2747.39s - 2749.23s] She's worked on it, but it's natural.
[2749.23s - 2750.63s] She didn't value it.
[2750.63s - 2753.47s] She didn't realize what a superpower it was.
[2753.47s - 2755.95s] So Jay, for the person who's listening,
[2755.95s - 2759.08s] who's now scanning their life
[2759.08s - 2760.56s] and thinking about what they're good at
[2760.56s - 2763.22s] and they're coming up with nothing,
[2763.22s - 2765.92s] what is your advice?
[2765.92s - 2769.00s] Here's my number one piece of advice.
[2769.00s - 2771.28s] Pick three people from your past.
[2771.28s - 2775.24s] Can be a work colleague, a family member and a friend.
[2775.24s - 2777.44s] These are people that know you deeply,
[2777.44s - 2780.17s] that you would say know me really, really well.
[2780.17s - 2782.21s] Not don't go and do this with anyone else.
[2782.21s - 2784.74s] Do this with people that know you really well.
[2784.74s - 2786.91s] And just ask them,
[2786.91s - 2789.12s] what's something that I do
[2789.12s - 2790.80s] that you always think of me
[2790.80s - 2793.06s] when you're struggling with something?
[2793.06s - 2796.02s] Ask them what's something that I've done in the past
[2796.02s - 2798.06s] for you or for anyone around us
[2798.06s - 2799.66s] that made you go, wow, that's really cool.
[2799.66s - 2801.54s] That's amazing.
[2801.54s - 2803.66s] And then sit down and ask them,
[2803.66s - 2806.18s] when you're struggling with something,
[2806.18s - 2807.26s] what do I help you do?
[2807.26s - 2808.78s] What do I help you solve?
[2808.78s - 2811.26s] All of a sudden you get all this input
[2811.26s - 2813.06s] from the people that know you the best
[2813.06s - 2816.34s] because they see in you what you don't see in yourself.
[2816.34s - 2817.98s] We have to remember that.
[2817.98s - 2820.22s] The people that know you and the people that love you,
[2820.22s - 2823.66s] they see in you what you don't see in yourself.
[2823.66s - 2826.78s] What you undervalue is what they deeply value.
[2826.78s - 2830.06s] What you take for granted is what they see as greatness.
[2830.06s - 2832.54s] What you kind of think is normal and average,
[2832.54s - 2834.70s] they adore about you.
[2834.70s - 2836.26s] But you've got to let them tell you that.
[2836.26s - 2838.54s] You've got to let them remind you of that
[2838.54s - 2841.47s] because otherwise you'll keep devaluing yourself.
[2841.47s - 2844.13s] You know what's interesting is that I remember,
[2845.13s - 2847.49s] this was like two years before I started the podcast,
[2849.28s - 2851.00s] would literally listen,
[2851.00s - 2853.00s] I still listen to your podcast, Jay,
[2853.00s - 2857.04s] and watch your videos and find so much inspiration from you.
[2857.04s - 2858.84s] I didn't realize I kind of did that with you
[2858.84s - 2860.84s] because I was very stuck.
[2860.84s - 2865.32s] I had reached a point where I was so tired of being on planes
[2865.32s - 2868.48s] and doing the motivational speaking at corporate events,
[2868.48s - 2870.04s] even though I loved it.
[2870.04s - 2874.24s] And I so wanted to get into the podcasting space
[2874.24s - 2876.52s] and I always know when I want something
[2876.52s - 2881.08s] because unlike you who is a very loving
[2881.08s - 2882.92s] and positive person,
[2882.92s - 2885.52s] my signs show up as jealousy.
[2885.52s - 2887.36s] I don't have the monk version,
[2887.36s - 2890.08s] I have the Mel Robbins version of inspiration.
[2890.08s - 2893.16s] It's sort of like agitation, right?
[2893.16s - 2895.96s] And so you have this incredible podcast
[2895.96s - 2900.96s] and I literally felt so jealous and excited for you.
[2901.20s - 2904.72s] But jealous because I'm doing it,
[2904.72s - 2906.48s] that means I can't do it.
[2906.48s - 2908.64s] And you know, it's already done
[2908.64s - 2910.28s] and since he's already doing it,
[2910.28s - 2912.56s] he's just such a great job with on purpose
[2912.56s - 2914.00s] and the most perfect name.
[2914.00s - 2915.40s] And you know, there's like,
[2915.40s - 2918.48s] you kind of see it in somebody else.
[2918.48s - 2921.60s] And you literally said to me, Mel,
[2921.60s - 2923.28s] you know what you should be doing?
[2923.28s - 2925.64s] You were, what are you gonna watch a podcast?
[2925.64s - 2927.24s] Like you would destroy it.
[2927.24s - 2930.64s] And so you reflected to me,
[2930.64s - 2935.44s] the thing that you saw as the next thing
[2935.44s - 2937.00s] that made the most sense.
[2937.00s - 2939.00s] And so I love that advice
[2939.00s - 2941.95s] because the people who do know you well
[2941.95s - 2944.47s] can see the things that you don't see in yourself
[2944.47s - 2947.87s] or see the possibilities
[2947.87s - 2951.99s] that you are actively holding yourself back from.
[2951.99s - 2952.83s] Yeah.
[2952.83s - 2953.75s] You know, one of the things that you've said
[2953.75s - 2955.23s] that I also love is you said,
[2955.23s - 2958.23s] weak people focus on others' weaknesses,
[2958.23s - 2960.23s] strong people focus on their strengths.
[2960.23s - 2961.87s] Can you unpack that?
[2961.87s - 2964.59s] Yeah, it actually perfectly fits with what you just said.
[2964.59s - 2970.04s] So weak people notice other people's mistakes and laugh.
[2971.59s - 2976.95s] Strong people notice other people's mistakes and learn.
[2976.95s - 2980.99s] Weak people talk about other people's problems
[2980.99s - 2982.51s] to feel better.
[2982.51s - 2985.47s] Strong people talk about other people's problems
[2985.47s - 2987.35s] to become better.
[2987.35s - 2990.43s] Weak people gossip about others
[2990.43s - 2992.59s] to build fake connections.
[2992.59s - 2997.84s] Strong people express vulnerability to build real ones.
[2998.12s - 3000.92s] And this one's the kicker that you were just talking about.
[3000.92s - 3004.44s] Weak people envy people ahead of them.
[3004.44s - 3008.36s] Strong people study people ahead of them.
[3008.36s - 3010.08s] And the interesting thing is
[3010.08s - 3013.12s] both people are looking at the same thing
[3013.12s - 3015.20s] but they're seeing different things
[3015.20s - 3018.44s] because no one is a weak or strong person.
[3018.44s - 3020.44s] It's just what you focus on.
[3020.44s - 3022.24s] And that's what I want people to realize.
[3022.24s - 3023.52s] There's a switch.
[3023.52s - 3026.68s] The switch for envy is study.
[3026.68s - 3027.80s] If you're jealous of someone,
[3027.80s - 3029.96s] if you're envious of someone, study them.
[3029.96s - 3032.04s] And I know we've had so many conversations
[3032.04s - 3034.12s] where we've both taught each other so much stuff.
[3034.12s - 3036.64s] You've always been so kind to share so many insights
[3036.64s - 3037.48s] and lessons.
[3037.48s - 3039.36s] I know I've done the same with you.
[3039.36s - 3040.20s] That's what we do.
[3040.20s - 3041.76s] We study each other.
[3041.76s - 3044.00s] And all of a sudden that envy turns
[3044.00s - 3049.00s] into appreciation, admiration, just complete awe
[3049.48s - 3052.36s] because you're like, now I know what it takes, right?
[3052.36s - 3055.32s] I remember when I used to see Cristiano Ronaldo
[3055.32s - 3057.52s] who I'm a huge fan of.
[3057.52s - 3061.48s] And I've been a fan of him ever since he was 17 years old.
[3061.48s - 3063.72s] And so I must have been like 14 or something like that
[3063.72s - 3065.36s] when I started following him.
[3065.36s - 3068.72s] This is 20 years ago now you're talking about more than that.
[3068.72s - 3070.80s] And you look at him and you think,
[3070.80s - 3072.44s] oh my God, like look how he looks,
[3072.44s - 3074.76s] look how he plays, everything else.
[3074.76s - 3078.00s] The moment you start studying his routine,
[3078.00s - 3080.28s] you realize what it actually takes.
[3080.28s - 3083.00s] Someone can sit there and be jealous of his life,
[3083.00s - 3083.84s] which is natural by the way.
[3083.84s - 3086.04s] And I don't want to make that seem like a bad thing.
[3086.04s - 3089.04s] But you turn jealousy into study.
[3089.04s - 3091.40s] You turn envy into study and all of a sudden
[3091.40s - 3092.60s] it's your best friend.
[3092.60s - 3094.48s] Envy can be your best friend
[3094.48s - 3096.28s] if you just replace it for study.
[3096.28s - 3097.48s] 100%.
[3097.48s - 3098.32s] I love that.
[3098.32s - 3100.48s] And that's exactly what I did.
[3100.48s - 3102.28s] The thing that's interesting is that,
[3102.28s - 3104.28s] with the reason why I wanted to highlight
[3104.28s - 3107.24s] that jealousy can be a useful tool.
[3107.24s - 3109.48s] Jealousy for me is very different than envy
[3109.48s - 3110.80s] because when I would look at you,
[3110.80s - 3115.52s] I would never envy you like you don't deserve that.
[3115.52s - 3119.56s] Jealousy for me is this deep stirring
[3119.56s - 3122.48s] because it's impossible to be jealous
[3122.48s - 3124.12s] of something that's not meant for you.
[3124.12s - 3124.96s] Yes.
[3124.96s - 3126.68s] And so I've never been jealous
[3126.68s - 3128.64s] of anybody who drives a Lamborghini.
[3128.64s - 3130.36s] I've never been jealous of anybody
[3130.36s - 3132.28s] that lives in a penthouse apartment.
[3132.28s - 3133.36s] I've never, you know what I'm saying?
[3133.36s - 3135.88s] Like I don't want those things.
[3135.88s - 3137.56s] But there was something about the way
[3137.56s - 3140.84s] that you took something that energizes you, learning,
[3140.84s - 3143.40s] connection, purpose,
[3143.40s - 3148.04s] and you created a business that was in service to others
[3148.04s - 3149.80s] around the things that energize you.
[3149.80s - 3152.56s] And that's what was, I think, ultimately
[3152.56s - 3154.76s] the thing that was stirring something in me.
[3154.76s - 3157.32s] And that's a super, super useful tool.
[3157.32s - 3159.36s] But the other thing I wanted to validate
[3159.36s - 3161.56s] is that the second I said,
[3161.56s - 3162.76s] I'm gonna walk toward this thing.
[3162.76s - 3164.40s] I'm gonna figure this out.
[3164.40s - 3168.84s] I spent two years studying you, talking to you,
[3168.84s - 3172.00s] and that piece of allowing yourself,
[3172.00s - 3175.08s] and it goes back to what you said about the experiment.
[3175.08s - 3178.16s] Learn, reflect, and part of reflecting
[3178.16s - 3180.06s] is experiment with something.
[3181.35s - 3182.83s] I was a student for two years.
[3182.83s - 3185.43s] There's a reason why we came out of the gate
[3185.43s - 3188.31s] and launched two episodes a week.
[3188.31s - 3190.15s] It's because I learned from you
[3190.19s - 3194.63s] that if you do want to have a successful show,
[3194.63s - 3196.95s] you have to do at least that many episodes.
[3196.95s - 3201.63s] And so the learning part and the studying others
[3201.63s - 3204.87s] and allowing others to lead the way and to show you
[3204.87s - 3209.87s] and to truly flip envy into learning from somebody.
[3211.07s - 3216.20s] That is worth $100 million in your life to understand
[3217.00s - 3220.16s] that everybody that is out in the world right now
[3220.16s - 3222.80s] is somebody that you can learn from.
[3222.80s - 3224.36s] It's just unbelievable.
[3224.36s - 3227.60s] And so thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing that.
[3227.60s - 3228.68s] And you know, there's another quote
[3228.68s - 3231.08s] that you have that I absolutely love, Jay.
[3231.08s - 3234.84s] We judge others by their actions, but ourselves,
[3234.84s - 3236.24s] by our intentions.
[3236.24s - 3237.24s] What does that mean?
[3237.24s - 3239.72s] This is something that actually my monk teachers
[3239.72s - 3241.80s] used to repeat to us a lot.
[3241.80s - 3245.28s] And it's a reality check that's a bit of a punch in the gut.
[3246.42s - 3249.90s] So we judge ourselves by our intentions
[3249.90s - 3253.08s] and we judge other people by their actions.
[3253.08s - 3255.88s] So if we feel our intention was good,
[3255.88s - 3257.92s] we feel we're good people.
[3257.92s - 3262.40s] But if someone has a bad action, we feel they're bad people.
[3262.40s - 3266.08s] Whereas what we should be doing is allowing other people
[3266.08s - 3270.32s] to be judged also for their intentions and their actions.
[3270.32s - 3275.32s] So it's a plea, a proposal, a pledge to say
[3275.48s - 3280.08s] before you judge someone, before you put someone in a box,
[3280.08s - 3283.12s] please learn what their intention was.
[3283.12s - 3285.52s] Because often you'll find that their intention
[3285.52s - 3288.04s] probably wasn't as malicious as you think.
[3288.04s - 3290.24s] It wasn't as manipulative as you think.
[3290.24s - 3293.36s] It wasn't as crazy as you think.
[3293.36s - 3294.80s] It was the same as yours.
[3294.80s - 3296.72s] They too had good intentions.
[3296.72s - 3299.52s] They also got into it with good intentions.
[3299.52s - 3301.36s] But we judge ourselves by our intentions
[3301.36s - 3302.96s] so we think we're good people
[3302.96s - 3304.52s] and we judge other people by their actions.
[3304.52s - 3306.08s] And so we think they're bad people.
[3306.08s - 3311.05s] If I made a mistake and you judge me for my action,
[3311.05s - 3312.85s] all of a sudden you've labeled me,
[3312.85s - 3315.85s] but my intention was so pure and so genuine.
[3315.85s - 3319.61s] I'll give you an example of something that happened recently
[3319.61s - 3323.37s] to me that I feel really, really applies to this.
[3323.37s - 3328.48s] And I was doing something with a friend
[3328.48s - 3332.76s] and we did a podcast together
[3332.76s - 3337.24s] and I was traveling on the road or whatever
[3337.24s - 3340.76s] and I didn't post something about it.
[3340.76s - 3345.24s] And my friend messaged me and was just feeling really upset
[3345.24s - 3347.08s] that I hadn't supported them,
[3347.08s - 3349.52s] that I hadn't noticed them, that I hadn't recognized them.
[3349.52s - 3350.64s] And now we're really good friends
[3350.64s - 3353.08s] so they were able to vocalize it to me.
[3353.08s - 3355.24s] But if we weren't, they would have immediately judged
[3355.24s - 3358.76s] and thought that I had some ulterior motive or some agenda.
[3358.76s - 3360.32s] And the truth is I'm so disconnected
[3360.32s - 3362.44s] from my social media in the sense that I don't post.
[3362.44s - 3364.24s] I'm not there, I'm on the road,
[3364.24s - 3366.88s] I try and stay off my phone for most of the day.
[3366.88s - 3368.24s] And all of a sudden I was thinking,
[3368.24s - 3372.04s] wait a minute, if they judge me for my action,
[3372.04s - 3373.84s] it looks like I don't care about them.
[3373.84s - 3375.48s] It looks like I don't value them.
[3375.48s - 3377.64s] It looks like this is an important to me.
[3377.64s - 3379.64s] But my intention was, I love you,
[3379.64s - 3380.72s] you're one of my favorite people,
[3380.72s - 3382.72s] I'm here to help you in whatever way possible.
[3382.72s - 3386.08s] And I just think about the amount of friendships we'd save,
[3386.08s - 3388.72s] the amount of relationships we'd save
[3388.72s - 3393.00s] if we just learned to judge people for their intentions,
[3393.00s - 3394.32s] not their actions.
[3394.32s - 3395.84s] Do you have like a little trick?
[3395.84s - 3400.84s] Cause my like emotions and pettiness can just flood me.
[3401.92s - 3404.24s] Like I've never had training as a monk chase.
[3404.24s - 3406.64s] I would imagine like your sort of engine
[3406.64s - 3408.00s] doesn't rev us high as mine,
[3408.00s - 3413.00s] but it is so easy to see friends out together.
[3413.08s - 3416.88s] And then immediately judge them for their actions
[3416.88s - 3417.96s] that they're excluding you,
[3417.96s - 3419.56s] that they must be talking about you,
[3419.56s - 3422.48s] that now they're closer than you are to them,
[3422.48s - 3425.24s] that it means something, it means you did something.
[3425.24s - 3427.84s] And then of course you respond to all of that emotion.
[3427.84s - 3430.76s] We are so fast to assume,
[3430.76s - 3432.88s] is there anything that you do
[3432.88s - 3435.80s] or that you recommend that people do?
[3435.80s - 3436.68s] Well, there's this thing,
[3436.68s - 3437.68s] I don't know if you've heard of it,
[3437.68s - 3439.36s] it's called the let them theory.
[3439.36s - 3441.12s] Oh my God.
[3441.12s - 3444.32s] Sorry, I had to, I had to, I was waiting for you.
[3444.44s - 3445.52s] Which is really good.
[3445.52s - 3446.96s] There's let them and then let me in it.
[3446.96s - 3447.88s] And it works perfectly,
[3447.88s - 3450.00s] which I genuinely believe it's amazing.
[3450.00s - 3452.68s] But to answer that your question,
[3452.68s - 3453.48s] I'll be honest with you,
[3453.48s - 3456.75s] when it's people that I know, I tell them.
[3457.91s - 3460.55s] I really believe it's important to tell people.
[3460.55s - 3461.39s] I check in with them.
[3461.39s - 3466.31s] I ask them, because if I know you, our relationship,
[3466.31s - 3470.37s] if our relationship means I can't ask you the question,
[3470.37s - 3472.67s] then it's a weak relationship.
[3472.67s - 3475.07s] If I ask you the question and we have a great conversation,
[3475.07s - 3477.39s] now our relationship is strengthened by it,
[3477.39s - 3479.15s] we actually got closer.
[3479.15s - 3484.07s] A hard conversation should make you closer to the person.
[3484.07s - 3487.23s] A hard conversation should not make you further away from them.
[3487.23s - 3489.90s] Say that again, Jay.
[3489.90s - 3493.38s] If you love someone and they say they love you,
[3493.38s - 3497.58s] a hard conversation should bring you closer together.
[3497.58s - 3501.02s] A hard conversation should not push you away from each other.
[3501.02s - 3503.70s] If you're scared to have a hard conversation
[3503.70s - 3507.02s] with someone you love, that means you're not that close.
[3507.02s - 3509.58s] Dude, I think those are the hardest people to talk to though.
[3509.58s - 3512.10s] Yeah, but that should be the easiest person to talk to
[3512.10s - 3514.66s] because you should be able to have a safe space to raise it.
[3514.66s - 3516.70s] And so if I'm close to someone,
[3516.70s - 3518.78s] if it was me and you, I would call you up.
[3518.78s - 3521.46s] And I actually trust we'd have a great conversation
[3521.46s - 3522.30s] because of it.
[3522.30s - 3523.14s] I know that.
[3523.14s - 3525.06s] I actually believe that if we ever had anything like that,
[3525.06s - 3526.98s] which we haven't and I would call you.
[3526.98s - 3530.77s] But what I find is if you can't call the person,
[3530.77s - 3532.37s] I would just think about,
[3532.37s - 3533.93s] this is the second part of that statement.
[3533.93s - 3535.81s] My monk teachers would always say,
[3535.81s - 3540.84s] instead of judging people by their actions,
[3541.24s - 3543.44s] judge them by their intentions
[3543.44s - 3547.80s] and judge yourself by your actions, not your intentions.
[3547.80s - 3551.12s] Oh, think about all the stupid things you've said,
[3551.12s - 3553.44s] you've done and got wrong.
[3553.44s - 3556.48s] And all of a sudden you start to recognize,
[3556.48s - 3559.28s] wait a minute, if someone judged me for that,
[3559.28s - 3560.78s] I'd feel pretty bad about it.
[3560.78s - 3562.94s] That doesn't define me, that's not who I am.
[3562.94s - 3565.30s] And all of a sudden when you have that reflection,
[3565.30s - 3567.34s] it flips the entire statement.
[3567.34s - 3569.62s] Wait a minute, that can't be who I am
[3569.62s - 3571.66s] and that's not who they are.
[3571.66s - 3572.74s] Amazing.
[3572.74s - 3574.58s] Here's another thing that you said recently, Jay,
[3574.58s - 3575.42s] that I love.
[3575.42s - 3580.54s] Someone out there would love to live your worst day.
[3580.54s - 3584.62s] What does that mean?
[3584.62s - 3588.29s] We're really quick to forget
[3588.29s - 3590.53s] that the day we're living today
[3590.53s - 3593.58s] is a day we dreamed of 10 years ago.
[3593.58s - 3597.28s] Maybe not in a complete picture.
[3597.28s - 3599.84s] Maybe you have the family you always wished for.
[3599.84s - 3601.56s] Maybe you're on the career path
[3601.56s - 3603.59s] that you've worked really hard for.
[3603.59s - 3607.03s] Maybe you're sitting in the home
[3607.03s - 3610.27s] that you couldn't even have imagined living in.
[3610.27s - 3612.19s] But there's a part of your life
[3612.19s - 3614.91s] that is exactly the life that you wanted.
[3614.91s - 3617.58s] Not all of it, but there's a part of it.
[3617.58s - 3621.57s] And when you forget that, you lose out
[3621.57s - 3624.69s] on recognizing you're already living in the dream
[3624.69s - 3627.21s] and that you already have the power
[3627.21s - 3629.05s] to create that future dream
[3629.05s - 3631.65s] because you've already done it once.
[3631.65s - 3634.85s] So you have to remember that where you are today
[3634.85s - 3636.73s] is what you wanted yesterday
[3636.73s - 3639.33s] and what you want today you can create tomorrow
[3639.33s - 3641.49s] because you've already done it once.
[3641.49s - 3643.73s] But we forget it so quickly.
[3643.73s - 3646.21s] I have to remind myself all the time, Mel.
[3646.21s - 3651.82s] I was driving to one of my friends' homes the other day.
[3652.22s - 3655.98s] And this is a friend that I used to grow up
[3655.98s - 3657.70s] watching on television,
[3657.70s - 3661.10s] watching their movies, listening to their music.
[3661.10s - 3664.97s] And they've become one of my closest friends in life.
[3664.97s - 3666.57s] And I had to pinch myself,
[3666.57s - 3668.37s] now we've been friends for like seven years,
[3668.37s - 3669.73s] I had to pinch myself to be like,
[3669.73s - 3671.41s] do I know what I'm doing?
[3671.41s - 3674.29s] Like I have to go back to being at the beginning
[3674.29s - 3675.97s] of that journey because otherwise
[3675.97s - 3677.97s] you can take anything for granted.
[3677.97s - 3679.77s] It's like you get to the top of a mountain
[3679.77s - 3683.13s] after a long hike and you look at a view,
[3683.13s - 3684.57s] you can get really familiar
[3684.57s - 3687.37s] and bored of that view really, really quick
[3687.37s - 3690.89s] unless you recognize the challenge it took,
[3690.89s - 3694.13s] the steps you took, the person you saw on the way up,
[3694.13s - 3696.61s] you have to sit there and remember all of that.
[3696.61s - 3699.49s] But the memory does this weird thing where it just forgets it.
[3699.49s - 3701.81s] As soon as you achieve something,
[3701.81s - 3705.09s] you forget how you dreamt of achieving it.
[3705.09s - 3707.05s] As soon as you get somewhere,
[3707.05s - 3710.17s] you forget how once upon a time,
[3710.17s - 3712.65s] you couldn't even imagine getting there.
[3712.65s - 3716.03s] Where you are today is what you wanted yesterday
[3716.03s - 3717.79s] and don't forget how you got there
[3717.79s - 3720.11s] because that's the hidden secret
[3720.11s - 3721.67s] of how you get to the next place.
[3722.98s - 3725.26s] How do you use gratitude
[3727.36s - 3730.48s] to lift yourself up in a moment
[3730.48s - 3733.52s] that is extraordinarily difficult?
[3733.52s - 3736.20s] You're grieving, you're in the middle of a breakup
[3736.20s - 3738.20s] or a divorce, you've lost your job.
[3738.20s - 3741.72s] Is there a way to use gratitude to lift yourself up
[3741.72s - 3744.92s] when life just really has knocked you down?
[3744.92s - 3747.18s] When life's knocked you down,
[3747.18s - 3752.18s] it's hard to be grateful for the good things in your life.
[3752.94s - 3755.34s] And it's sometimes bad advice
[3755.34s - 3757.86s] because someone's just lost a marriage,
[3757.86s - 3760.18s] lost a family member, whatever it may be.
[3760.18s - 3762.26s] So there's the time for grieving, of course.
[3762.26s - 3763.10s] Absolutely.
[3763.10s - 3764.66s] And that's the mentally healthy response
[3764.66s - 3767.50s] to have the avalanche of emotions.
[3767.50s - 3769.54s] But if you're gonna be grateful,
[3769.54s - 3773.14s] you sometimes have to do a counterintuitive practice.
[3773.14s - 3776.30s] Instead of being grateful for what you have,
[3776.30s - 3779.70s] think about how your life would be without something.
[3779.70s - 3783.90s] I find that to be the greatest thing for gratitude.
[3783.90s - 3786.22s] If I try and be grateful for something
[3786.22s - 3787.94s] that I've had for a long time,
[3787.94s - 3790.46s] I may get bored of it, I may be familiar with it.
[3790.46s - 3793.62s] But if I ask myself, what would my life be without that?
[3793.62s - 3796.94s] Oh my gosh, all of a sudden, I'm so grateful.
[3796.94s - 3798.54s] What would my life be without?
[3798.54s - 3800.46s] Have you ever had it where you just like,
[3800.46s - 3803.10s] hurt your little finger or like get a little cut?
[3803.10s - 3804.70s] And now you can't use a finger
[3804.70s - 3805.74s] or you can't use a thumb.
[3805.74s - 3806.58s] And all of a sudden you're like,
[3806.58s - 3808.82s] oh my God, I'm so grateful for my hand.
[3808.82s - 3810.86s] Because what would my life be like without it?
[3810.86s - 3813.10s] This is the way we have to trick our mind.
[3813.10s - 3815.50s] Humans are better at noticing something
[3815.50s - 3816.54s] when it's about to go away.
[3816.54s - 3817.86s] We always hear the phrase,
[3817.86s - 3820.22s] you don't know what you've got until it's gone.
[3820.22s - 3822.78s] So we have to use that in our favor to think,
[3822.78s - 3825.30s] not what do I have that I'm so grateful for.
[3825.30s - 3826.90s] What could I not live without?
[3826.90s - 3828.82s] That is life changing.
[3828.82s - 3830.46s] I've never actually thought about it like that.
[3830.46s - 3832.42s] I was sitting there at the moment, you said it
[3832.42s - 3837.01s] and I thought, how would I feel if Jay wasn't in my life?
[3837.01s - 3839.29s] And I'm grateful for you.
[3839.29s - 3843.73s] But the second I envisioned you, sorry Jay, evaporating
[3843.73s - 3847.25s] and not knowing you as a friend, it's like it 10xed it.
[3847.25s - 3850.81s] And even the example of, you know, you said the finger,
[3850.81s - 3853.25s] like I was in the hotel the other night
[3853.25s - 3855.65s] and I was walking to the bathroom, of course,
[3855.65s - 3858.21s] it's a 56-year-old woman at three o'clock in the morning
[3858.21s - 3860.69s] and I hit my toe on the bed frame.
[3860.69s - 3862.49s] You're gonna be like, oh!
[3862.49s - 3865.29s] And it feels like you've ripped it off your foot.
[3866.28s - 3870.52s] It's amazing to me that my experience of that is,
[3870.52s - 3872.88s] you know, screaming an agony and then thinking,
[3872.88s - 3875.44s] how can something so little hurt so much?
[3875.44s - 3880.00s] And your reframe is imagine my life without my foot
[3880.00s - 3881.92s] and the gratitude that floods you.
[3881.92s - 3884.12s] I mean, that's incredible, Jay.
[3884.12s - 3885.24s] It really works.
[3885.24s - 3887.24s] It really works and it's so simple.
[3887.24s - 3890.00s] And, you know, you can apply it to small and big things,
[3890.00s - 3892.48s] but even I was thinking, as you were saying, friendship,
[3892.48s - 3894.24s] I was thinking about our friend Dave Hollis.
[3894.24s - 3895.24s] Oh, yeah.
[3895.24s - 3900.16s] And, you know, it's, I know you spoke at his funeral
[3900.16s - 3903.52s] and I sadly couldn't be there, but as I'm thinking about it,
[3903.52s - 3904.88s] I'm like, I was grateful for Dave.
[3904.88s - 3907.24s] I had to get some really beautiful interactions with Dave.
[3907.24s - 3908.32s] I really did.
[3908.32s - 3910.70s] He was a wonderful man.
[3910.70s - 3912.98s] But it's only when you sadly lose someone
[3912.98s - 3914.54s] that you really recognize, wait a minute,
[3914.54s - 3915.90s] I can't call them again.
[3915.90s - 3917.42s] I'm not going to get a call from him again.
[3917.42s - 3919.62s] I'm not going to see him at our next get together.
[3919.62s - 3920.46s] And then all of a sudden,
[3920.46s - 3922.26s] and so like, do that while people are here.
[3922.26s - 3923.42s] And it's not a fear thing.
[3923.42s - 3925.26s] It's a gratitude thing, right?
[3925.26s - 3926.74s] It's not like I'm living in fear
[3926.74s - 3928.66s] of what if I lose this person.
[3928.66s - 3933.34s] You're asking yourself, what would my life be without this?
[3933.34s - 3935.14s] Oh my gosh, I'm so glad I have it.
[3935.14s - 3936.46s] I'm so grateful I have it.
[3936.46s - 3939.54s] I'm so lucky and fortunate I get to have this.
[3939.54s - 3942.18s] That's what you're feeling your life with, not with fear.
[3942.18s - 3945.90s] I really, I want to thank you for that.
[3945.90s - 3947.94s] Because especially that last part
[3947.94s - 3951.38s] about you can actually kind of do things out of fear,
[3951.38s - 3955.22s] or you can have the fuel and the energizing source of it,
[3955.22s - 3956.78s] be gratitude, and I'll give you an example.
[3956.78s - 3957.62s] Please.
[3957.62s - 3960.46s] So my dad is 80 years old.
[3960.46s - 3964.46s] And I think a lot about the fact that if I'm lucky,
[3964.46s - 3967.50s] I'm going to get 10 more, maybe 15 more,
[3967.50s - 3969.40s] if I'm crazy lucky.
[3970.40s - 3973.68s] Holidays with them, birthdays with them.
[3973.68s - 3976.00s] And I realize as I'm listening to you
[3976.00s - 3979.82s] that I've been coming from this sense of fear
[3979.82s - 3981.62s] because there's this sense like,
[3981.62s - 3983.22s] I got to make the most of the time that I have
[3983.22s - 3984.86s] while I have the time.
[3984.86s - 3989.22s] And I can take what you just shared and say,
[3989.22s - 3992.18s] I am so grateful that he's here,
[3992.18s - 3996.66s] that I want to make use of the time that I have
[3996.66s - 3998.42s] while he's here.
[3998.42s - 4002.82s] Which is a very different energy to ground yourself in.
[4002.82s - 4003.66s] You're so right.
[4003.66s - 4004.50s] You're spot on.
[4004.50s - 4007.90s] It's this idea of having the full picture.
[4007.90s - 4008.74s] Talk more about that.
[4008.74s - 4010.38s] What do you mean?
[4010.38s - 4011.22s] Yeah.
[4011.22s - 4013.58s] And I want to approach it from a really interesting take.
[4013.58s - 4015.14s] And it comes from what we're talking about
[4015.14s - 4017.73s] a few seconds ago around comparison.
[4017.73s - 4020.45s] So now there's only really,
[4020.45s - 4022.33s] apart from what we said about how to turn jealousy,
[4022.33s - 4023.81s] which I love,
[4023.81s - 4029.04s] there's really only one way to overcome comparison.
[4029.04s - 4031.60s] And it's having the full picture
[4031.60s - 4034.67s] of the person you compare yourself to.
[4034.67s - 4036.55s] You've got to know what's happening
[4036.55s - 4039.35s] behind their perfect Instagram posts.
[4039.35s - 4042.23s] Do you know how many times they cried themselves
[4042.23s - 4044.15s] to sleep this week?
[4044.15s - 4046.07s] Do you know the argument they just had
[4046.07s - 4048.20s] with their mom last night?
[4048.20s - 4049.64s] Do you know the challenge they're going through
[4049.64s - 4051.66s] with their kids right now?
[4051.66s - 4054.94s] Do you know about the family member who has an illness?
[4054.94s - 4057.94s] All of a sudden when you actually get the full picture
[4057.94s - 4059.91s] of someone's life,
[4059.91s - 4062.31s] you now don't compare yourself to them
[4062.31s - 4065.19s] because you realize no one's life is perfect.
[4065.19s - 4067.80s] They're just better at cropping out the pain.
[4067.80s - 4069.60s] They're just better at editing out the parts
[4069.60s - 4072.04s] that they don't want you to see.
[4072.04s - 4075.44s] But when you see what someone's really going through,
[4075.44s - 4078.20s] all of a sudden you won't compare it anymore
[4078.20s - 4080.12s] because you recognize everyone's going
[4080.12s - 4081.56s] through something difficult.
[4081.56s - 4083.68s] Jay, another thing that you remind us all
[4083.68s - 4085.72s] that I just love is the bad times reveal
[4085.72s - 4088.60s] who the great people are in your life.
[4088.60s - 4094.24s] Do people show up for you when you're going through a bad day?
[4094.24s - 4097.44s] Are people present for your good days
[4097.44s - 4100.34s] but absent for your bad days?
[4100.34s - 4103.38s] Do people turn up, call, check in
[4103.38s - 4105.43s] when things are going wrong?
[4105.43s - 4109.15s] Does someone see the best in you
[4109.15s - 4111.46s] when you're your worst self?
[4111.46s - 4113.93s] Does someone see the good in you
[4113.93s - 4116.47s] when you might be having a bad day?
[4116.47s - 4121.45s] That person is more special than anyone you'll ever meet.
[4121.45s - 4123.67s] So keep them close.
[4123.67s - 4126.91s] Don't run the risk of pushing them away,
[4126.91s - 4130.61s] losing them, taking them for granted
[4130.61s - 4137.05s] because one day you'll wish that they'll call and check in
[4137.33s - 4140.84s] and you might have lost them by then.
[4140.84s - 4145.72s] So the bad times in our life genuinely show us
[4145.72s - 4149.43s] the great people because it's at that point
[4149.43s - 4152.95s] that you're hard to support, you're hard to love,
[4152.95s - 4154.87s] you're hard to give energy to.
[4154.87s - 4157.59s] It might not be popular to be your friend
[4157.59s - 4159.19s] which what does that prove?
[4159.19s - 4163.83s] It proves that person values you more than popularity.
[4163.83s - 4167.79s] It proves that person values you more than their reputation.
[4167.79s - 4172.88s] It proves that that person values you more than all the stress.
[4174.24s - 4177.40s] That is the most special person you'll ever meet
[4177.40s - 4179.76s] and everyone has at least one of them
[4179.76s - 4182.68s] but the problem is we want attention from these people
[4182.68s - 4185.79s] so we lose affection from these people.
[4185.79s - 4186.99s] It's so true.
[4186.99s - 4188.83s] You're really good at that.
[4188.83s - 4192.61s] You're really good at showing up for your friends.
[4192.61s - 4195.11s] It's because people have shown up for me.
[4195.11s - 4196.47s] That's the reality of it.
[4196.47s - 4198.35s] I'm good at showing up for people
[4198.35s - 4200.07s] because people have shown up for me
[4200.07s - 4202.11s] and it's not always the same people.
[4202.11s - 4203.43s] That's the mistake we make.
[4203.43s - 4205.67s] We think that the people we show up for
[4205.67s - 4208.11s] should be the people that show up back for us.
[4208.11s - 4209.23s] Oh, say more about that.
[4209.23s - 4212.91s] So we believe that when we show up for someone
[4212.91s - 4214.67s] they should show up for us.
[4214.67s - 4219.83s] We want people to love us in the same way we love them
[4220.07s - 4223.31s] but people won't love you the way you love them.
[4223.31s - 4226.83s] And that's okay because there's someone over here
[4226.83s - 4230.31s] who's showing up for you and you're missing out on them.
[4230.31s - 4232.43s] There's someone over here who's turning up for you
[4232.43s - 4233.83s] who's checking in on you.
[4233.83s - 4235.91s] I remember saying to my monk teacher,
[4235.91s - 4239.35s] I said, I feel like I give so much love to others.
[4239.35s - 4242.91s] I said, I feel like I show up so much for other people
[4242.91s - 4245.52s] but they don't show up for me.
[4245.52s - 4247.27s] What do I do?
[4247.27s - 4250.15s] And he said, love is like a circle.
[4250.15s - 4254.31s] Whatever love you give out will always come back to you
[4254.31s - 4256.23s] but it might just not be from those people
[4256.23s - 4258.15s] you gave it to in the first place.
[4258.15s - 4260.75s] But if you spend your whole life wondering
[4260.75s - 4263.59s] why that person doesn't give you love back,
[4263.59s - 4266.31s] you're ignoring all these people over here
[4266.31s - 4268.79s] who give you love all the time.
[4268.79s - 4271.55s] So turn around, look around you.
[4271.55s - 4273.75s] There is someone who's showing up for you,
[4273.75s - 4276.19s] turning up for you, checking in with you
[4276.19s - 4278.66s] even when you don't acknowledge them
[4278.66s - 4280.18s] and start looking towards that person
[4280.18s - 4281.82s] and giving them some respect.
[4281.82s - 4283.34s] I want to dig deeper into that.
[4283.34s - 4284.18s] Yeah, please.
[4284.18s - 4289.47s] Because I feel like relationships
[4289.83s - 4292.63s] have become extremely transactional.
[4292.63s - 4295.11s] If I check in on you, you got to check in on me.
[4295.11s - 4296.51s] That's the sign that you care
[4296.51s - 4299.39s] and I love what you just said
[4299.39s - 4300.63s] that there are gonna be times
[4300.63s - 4302.47s] where you show up for people
[4302.47s - 4304.79s] and they're not gonna show up for you either
[4304.79s - 4307.39s] because they can't or they don't know what's going on
[4307.39s - 4309.07s] or they got other things going on
[4309.07s - 4311.39s] or they're not actually the right person
[4311.39s - 4314.14s] to support you right now.
[4314.14s - 4317.26s] And them showing up feels more like a,
[4317.26s - 4318.62s] is gonna feel more like a burden.
[4318.62s - 4320.90s] And so maybe that's also spiritually speaking
[4320.90s - 4322.66s] why they're not showing up.
[4322.66s - 4325.14s] And I love the fact that if you think about love
[4325.14s - 4329.36s] like a circle and you show up because that's who you are.
[4329.36s - 4332.68s] And in those moments when you need support,
[4332.68s - 4334.84s] recognize that there actually are people
[4334.84s - 4337.64s] around you trying to support you
[4337.64s - 4339.96s] or that are capable of it
[4339.96s - 4343.72s] if you simply let them know that you need it.
[4343.72s - 4346.32s] That's a completely different way to think about things
[4346.32s - 4349.16s] because we keep score in relationships.
[4349.16s - 4350.08s] And that if I'm the one
[4350.08s - 4352.60s] that's always reaching out to my siblings,
[4352.60s - 4355.48s] that if they don't reach back to me
[4355.48s - 4357.80s] that it means they don't care.
[4357.80s - 4361.04s] And sometimes it actually just means
[4361.04s - 4363.24s] that's not how they express their love.
[4363.24s - 4364.24s] Yes.
[4364.24s - 4368.04s] And that the thing that you're seeking from them
[4368.04s - 4370.56s] actually is gonna come from a friend.
[4370.56s - 4373.80s] And if you're keeping score in your relationships,
[4373.80s - 4376.92s] you're actually the one that's gonna destroy them.
[4376.92s - 4378.13s] Yes.
[4378.13s - 4380.13s] Can you like dig into that with me, Jay?
[4380.13s - 4381.41s] Well, that's powerful, Mel.
[4381.41s - 4384.57s] I love what you're saying and it's so true.
[4384.57s - 4389.17s] It's the first thing we have to ask ourselves is,
[4389.17s - 4392.13s] did I show up for you for you
[4392.13s - 4394.57s] or did I show up for you for me?
[4394.57s - 4395.73s] What do you mean?
[4395.73s - 4397.73s] If I'm showing up for you for you,
[4397.73s - 4400.33s] then I don't need you to show up back for me.
[4400.33s - 4403.53s] But if I showed up to prove to you that I showed up,
[4403.53s - 4405.29s] now I need you to show up back for me
[4405.29s - 4407.85s] to prove to me that I did the right thing.
[4407.85s - 4409.93s] It's almost like an insecurity of like,
[4409.93s - 4412.37s] I'm doing it because I expect you to do it back,
[4412.37s - 4413.85s] which is what you said at the beginning.
[4413.85s - 4415.66s] It's transactional.
[4415.66s - 4420.28s] If I do something for you and I don't expect anything back,
[4420.28s - 4422.00s] that's called love.
[4422.00s - 4425.32s] If I do something for you and I expect it back,
[4425.32s - 4428.44s] that's called a transaction, that's business.
[4428.44s - 4430.83s] That's a contract.
[4430.83s - 4434.07s] I don't wanna have a contract with someone I love.
[4434.07s - 4436.11s] So why would I be measuring them
[4436.11s - 4439.47s] based on how they do the exact same thing back for me?
[4439.47s - 4441.83s] If you think about that, let's say Mel,
[4441.83s - 4443.55s] I organized your birthday party
[4443.55s - 4446.11s] because I love organizing birthday parties.
[4446.11s - 4449.27s] Does that mean you have to organize my birthday party
[4449.27s - 4451.67s] to show me you love me equally?
[4451.67s - 4453.75s] What if you didn't organize my birthday party
[4453.75s - 4457.51s] but you called me when I had a really tough day at work
[4457.51s - 4458.59s] and you checked in with me
[4458.59s - 4460.77s] and gave me some great wisdom and insight?
[4460.77s - 4462.31s] Is that equal?
[4462.31s - 4464.59s] Or actually, do I see that as not equal
[4464.59s - 4466.39s] because you didn't spend seven days
[4466.39s - 4468.59s] or seven months planning an event for me?
[4468.59s - 4472.27s] Now, are we cutting time or are we measuring emotion?
[4472.27s - 4473.87s] How do you value to?
[4473.87s - 4475.75s] I can't value you based on the hours
[4475.75s - 4476.67s] you put into our friendship.
[4476.67s - 4478.55s] Let's say that I was struggling something
[4478.55s - 4480.85s] and you sent me a text.
[4480.85s - 4482.73s] But when you were struggling, I called you up.
[4482.73s - 4484.41s] Does that mean I care more about you?
[4484.41s - 4486.81s] Or was that text just perfect for what I needed?
[4486.81s - 4489.73s] We're measuring these very immeasurable things.
[4489.73s - 4494.29s] Are we counting days, hours, months, emotions, laughs?
[4494.29s - 4496.21s] What are you gonna keep a score on?
[4496.21s - 4498.17s] And so I think we're keeping a score on things
[4498.17s - 4499.89s] that you can't measure.
[4499.89s - 4501.89s] And this is one of the limits I have
[4501.89s - 4504.25s] with the love languages.
[4504.25s - 4506.61s] I actually don't want you to love me
[4506.61s - 4508.69s] the way I wanna be loved.
[4508.69s - 4510.33s] Like, what do you mean by that?
[4510.33s - 4513.41s] I believe that if I want you to love me
[4513.41s - 4516.29s] exactly the way I want to be loved,
[4516.29s - 4519.17s] I'm actually limiting how much you can love me
[4519.17s - 4521.82s] because you have something to offer me
[4521.82s - 4525.58s] that is different to what I even know I can receive.
[4525.58s - 4526.82s] So if I say to you, Mel,
[4526.82s - 4529.42s] the only way you can show me love is gifts
[4529.42s - 4532.00s] because that's what blows my mind.
[4532.00s - 4534.28s] That's great, I do like gifts.
[4534.28s - 4535.12s] But guess what?
[4535.12s - 4539.12s] What if your best way to offer love is acts of service?
[4539.12s - 4542.52s] What if your best way of love is quality time?
[4542.52s - 4546.64s] Now I'm gonna miss out on the greatness you have to offer me
[4546.64s - 4549.08s] because I'm gonna say I only want you to give me this.
[4549.08s - 4551.04s] What if you wanted to give me the world?
[4551.04s - 4552.60s] And I said, just give me a gift.
[4552.60s - 4556.56s] So I'm limiting how much love,
[4556.56s - 4558.32s] so when love matures,
[4558.32s - 4561.68s] I think when love is young, it's a great principle.
[4561.68s - 4564.00s] But when love matures,
[4564.00s - 4566.16s] and by the way, me and Radhi have been through this.
[4566.16s - 4568.84s] When I met Radhi, I was that guy, so I love gifts.
[4568.84s - 4570.32s] And I had to do a lot of unpacking
[4570.32s - 4571.52s] as to why I love gifts.
[4571.52s - 4572.60s] Why do you love gifts?
[4572.60s - 4575.12s] It's because my mom couldn't always be there
[4575.12s - 4575.96s] for me on my birthday.
[4575.96s - 4576.88s] We couldn't spend quality time.
[4576.88s - 4578.40s] She was working, she was the breadwinner,
[4578.40s - 4580.60s] but she always got me that one gift I'd come home
[4580.60s - 4582.08s] and the power ranger would be wrapped up there
[4582.08s - 4584.36s] and I'd unwrap it and I'd have so much joy.
[4584.36s - 4586.12s] So when I met Radhi,
[4586.12s - 4589.60s] Radhi comes from a family where quality time is the gift.
[4589.60s - 4591.08s] They don't really give each other gifts,
[4591.08s - 4592.16s] which to me when I first met her,
[4592.16s - 4593.80s] I was like, this is bizarre.
[4593.80s - 4595.84s] And what is wrong with all of you?
[4595.84s - 4598.56s] And I wanted, this is ridiculous,
[4598.56s - 4601.44s] but I remember the new iPad mini was out
[4601.44s - 4602.60s] and I'd kind of hinted to her
[4602.60s - 4604.40s] that I wanted this iPad mini.
[4604.40s - 4609.20s] Anyway, I unwrap my gift on my birthday and it's an Aces.
[4609.20s - 4611.16s] I was like, I want an iPad mini,
[4611.16s - 4612.68s] who gets someone an Aces?
[4614.64s - 4616.60s] And it sounds ridiculous,
[4616.60s - 4619.60s] but I'm telling it because of how ridiculous we can be.
[4619.60s - 4620.96s] And she literally said to me,
[4620.96s - 4622.60s] she was like, oh no, but I asked my family
[4622.60s - 4624.28s] and they said this one's got better specs
[4624.28s - 4626.16s] and it's actually better than the iPad
[4626.16s - 4627.12s] and it's better resolution.
[4627.12s - 4629.24s] I was like, but I wanted the iPad.
[4629.24s - 4633.50s] And I'm telling this story because Radhi and me
[4633.50s - 4636.34s] learned as our relationship developed
[4636.34s - 4639.58s] that Radhi had so many beautiful ways to show me love
[4639.58s - 4642.54s] and she turned up in so many amazing ways,
[4642.54s - 4644.26s] but I would ignore all of them
[4644.26s - 4646.46s] because I didn't get a gift on my birthday
[4646.46s - 4648.58s] or the gift I wanted on my birthday.
[4648.58s - 4651.42s] And I think so many of us are ignoring
[4651.42s - 4654.86s] the amazing ways our partners, our kids,
[4654.86s - 4656.58s] our parents show up for us
[4656.58s - 4660.74s] because they don't show up in exactly the way we want.
[4660.74s - 4662.56s] And here's the point,
[4662.56s - 4667.56s] no one will ever love you exactly how you want
[4668.00s - 4671.72s] because that's your job and that's God's job.
[4671.72s - 4676.56s] We will wish, wait, want every single week, month and year
[4676.56s - 4680.00s] for someone to love us in a particular exact way
[4680.00s - 4682.64s] and they will always fail us
[4682.64s - 4683.60s] because that was your job.
[4683.60s - 4685.20s] It was never theirs in the first place.
[4685.20s - 4686.04s] That was God's job.
[4686.04s - 4688.16s] It was never theirs in the first place.
[4688.16s - 4691.20s] So open yourself up to the limitless love
[4691.20s - 4692.24s] that people show up.
[4692.24s - 4695.36s] Maybe your partner makes you coffee in the morning.
[4695.36s - 4697.76s] Maybe they're the ones that make the bed.
[4697.76s - 4699.24s] Maybe they're the one when you're on the road
[4699.24s - 4702.04s] to check in with you and order something to your hotel room.
[4702.04s - 4704.04s] Maybe they're the one that reminds you
[4704.04s - 4706.24s] that you forgot your glasses or your wallet.
[4706.24s - 4709.68s] Maybe they're the one that remembers to put the dishes away,
[4709.68s - 4713.00s] whatever it is, they're doing something and it's love.
[4713.00s - 4716.36s] They may not say I love you, it may not look like I love you,
[4716.36s - 4717.88s] but it is.
[4717.88s - 4719.08s] And by the way, when you told them,
[4719.08s - 4720.60s] hey, you didn't get me this one thing
[4720.60s - 4723.00s] or you didn't say this one thing,
[4723.00s - 4726.83s] they're thinking, how did you miss all of the other things?
[4726.83s - 4727.67s] And guess what?
[4727.67s - 4729.71s] You discouraged them from loving you.
[4729.71s - 4732.23s] You don't encourage someone to love you
[4732.23s - 4734.43s] by telling them you're disappointed.
[4734.43s - 4735.51s] No one's gonna give you more
[4735.51s - 4737.03s] because you made them feel bad.
[4737.03s - 4740.07s] People love you more when they see you noticed
[4740.07s - 4742.19s] all the little things they did.
[4742.19s - 4746.69s] And all of a sudden they feel inspired to give you more.
[4746.69s - 4753.71s] Jay, it really, as I was listening to you,
[4756.88s - 4758.84s] I was first of all thinking about what an asshole
[4758.84s - 4760.88s] I am into my marriage, so thanks a lot.
[4762.72s - 4763.80s] We love you, Chris.
[4765.84s - 4768.48s] Because I so saw myself, right?
[4768.48s - 4769.88s] Me too, by the way.
[4769.88s - 4774.70s] Yeah, and then something extraordinary happened
[4774.70s - 4775.90s] as I was listening to you.
[4780.01s - 4786.48s] And that is what a shame that most of us are so busy
[4788.76s - 4793.08s] looking for the one way we expect to be loved,
[4793.08s - 4796.40s] that we miss all of the love that is around us
[4796.40s - 4799.72s] and available to us that we don't let in.
[4799.72s - 4804.57s] And what an opportunity to have a shift
[4804.57s - 4810.66s] and really change the way that you see life,
[4811.18s - 4817.04s] you see relationships and what you open yourself up to.
[4817.04s - 4822.20s] If there's one thing from that perspective
[4822.72s - 4824.52s] and what you learned about yourself
[4824.52s - 4826.16s] and what you learned about what's possible
[4826.16s - 4830.72s] that being loved the way you want to be loved is your job.
[4830.72s - 4833.08s] It's God's job, it's the universe's job.
[4833.08s - 4835.24s] It's not somebody else's job.
[4835.24s - 4840.59s] And I would say learning how to allow in
[4840.59s - 4843.31s] other people's expression of love
[4843.31s - 4845.75s] is a huge opportunity for you.
[4845.75s - 4849.79s] Whether it's your friends, whether it's your parents,
[4849.79s - 4853.59s] whether it's, you know, your kids, your partner, everybody.
[4853.59s - 4855.19s] Like, how do you do that?
[4855.19s - 4857.27s] Especially if you've been a first-class asshole,
[4857.27s - 4861.11s] like me, just been like, you didn't do it this way.
[4861.11s - 4863.91s] And I thought nobody texted me on the thing
[4863.91s - 4864.95s] and nobody checked in.
[4864.95s - 4868.47s] Like, we're so focused on what's not happening
[4868.47s - 4871.43s] that you're blocking what actually is.
[4871.43s - 4874.51s] And then you just keep preventing it
[4874.51s - 4879.82s] from being an experience it's available to you right now.
[4879.82s - 4880.90s] Thank you for sharing that.
[4880.90s - 4882.38s] And by the way, I feel the same way too.
[4882.38s - 4885.10s] It took me so many years of unpacking
[4885.10s - 4888.42s] to understand why I was so fixated.
[4888.42s - 4891.42s] But the way I think about it is
[4891.42s - 4896.06s] the person that texts you when they don't want anything.
[4896.06s - 4898.26s] Don't forget that person.
[4898.26s - 4902.00s] The person who calls you when they don't need anything.
[4902.00s - 4904.12s] Don't forget that person.
[4904.12s - 4908.06s] The person who comes over and swings by,
[4908.06s - 4911.13s] just a chat, even when you're busy.
[4911.13s - 4913.15s] Don't forget that person.
[4913.15s - 4917.35s] The person who walks in and remembered
[4917.35s - 4919.27s] that you had something happening at work
[4919.27s - 4920.67s] or something happening in your home
[4920.67s - 4922.63s] or something happening in your life.
[4922.63s - 4924.55s] Don't forget that person.
[4924.55s - 4929.55s] We do it by starting to recognize those people in our life
[4930.68s - 4935.26s] that are not big and crazy, but they're consistent.
[4935.26s - 4937.14s] The consistent people in our life
[4937.14s - 4939.34s] are the people that are forgotten.
[4939.34s - 4941.50s] The people who've become like furniture.
[4941.50s - 4943.62s] The people who've become so familiar.
[4943.62s - 4944.46s] But guess what?
[4944.46s - 4947.02s] They were the people that texted you when they needed nothing.
[4947.02s - 4949.34s] They're the people that called you when they wanted nothing.
[4949.34s - 4950.82s] They're the people that checked in with you
[4950.82s - 4953.77s] with no transaction required.
[4953.77s - 4955.49s] Take a moment to just think of that person
[4955.49s - 4958.21s] and messes them now and don't ask for anything.
[4958.21s - 4959.68s] Just tell them.
[4959.68s - 4961.24s] Tell them how you feel.
[4961.24s - 4963.92s] Messes them and say, thank you so much
[4963.92s - 4967.08s] for showing up for me when you didn't want anything in return.
[4967.08s - 4970.04s] Thank you so much for checking in with me
[4970.04s - 4971.96s] when you got nothing out of it.
[4971.96s - 4973.76s] I acknowledge them for that
[4973.76s - 4975.80s] because we have to start noticing it.
[4975.80s - 4977.04s] We have to start noticing it.
[4977.04s - 4980.60s] It's so easy and this is why I have this habit
[4980.60s - 4982.68s] that whenever I think of someone,
[4982.68s - 4984.08s] I send them a message.
[4984.08s - 4986.92s] Whatever my thought may be, I'll send them a message
[4986.92s - 4988.40s] and the message will just say,
[4988.40s - 4992.11s] thinking of you, Mel, sending you lots of love.
[4992.11s - 4994.03s] And I do it all the time.
[4994.03s - 4996.87s] The amount of times in the last month
[4996.87s - 4999.75s] that that person has responded to me immediately
[4999.75s - 5002.31s] and said, I was just talking about you.
[5002.31s - 5004.59s] I was just thinking about you.
[5004.59s - 5007.79s] Oh my gosh, I was just sharing something you put online
[5007.79s - 5010.03s] or shared on Instagram or whatever it may have been.
[5010.03s - 5011.47s] The amount of times that's happened
[5011.51s - 5014.10s] is truly blowing my mind.
[5014.10s - 5016.78s] And I've realized because you know,
[5016.78s - 5019.34s] we all have this sense, you and I,
[5019.34s - 5021.54s] all of us, everyone who's listening and watching right now
[5021.54s - 5025.32s] has this intuition when someone needs us.
[5025.32s - 5026.84s] But we're scared.
[5026.84s - 5029.68s] We're scared to message with no reason.
[5029.68s - 5031.40s] We're scared we might be disrupting someone
[5031.40s - 5032.52s] or they're too busy.
[5032.52s - 5035.24s] We're scared, but no, no, no, that's what that person wants.
[5035.24s - 5038.08s] That person wants you to just send love when they're busy.
[5038.08s - 5040.60s] That person wants you to say hello
[5040.60s - 5041.72s] when they're having a crazy day.
[5041.72s - 5042.56s] Because guess what?
[5042.56s - 5043.84s] You're the only person doing that.
[5043.84s - 5045.08s] Everyone else is asking for something
[5045.08s - 5047.73s] or wants something from them.
[5047.73s - 5048.93s] The best time to message someone
[5048.93s - 5050.49s] is when you don't want anything.
[5050.49s - 5052.49s] You actually talk about this a lot online,
[5052.49s - 5053.89s] the power of calling somebody,
[5053.89s - 5055.45s] the power of texting somebody
[5055.45s - 5058.33s] and how much we underestimate this small action.
[5058.33s - 5062.86s] And you also said that we have this amazing sense
[5062.86s - 5065.82s] to sense when somebody needs you.
[5065.82s - 5070.48s] And what I would ask us all to consider
[5070.48s - 5074.48s] is that the people that you care about always need you.
[5074.48s - 5080.01s] And that check-in is you doing something
[5080.01s - 5083.25s] that we all need, which is this small act
[5083.25s - 5085.61s] of loving somebody and seeing them
[5085.61s - 5088.69s] and just saying, I have you in mind.
[5088.69s - 5092.37s] One of the reasons why I always tell the person
[5092.37s - 5093.57s] who's listening that I love them
[5093.57s - 5097.15s] is because I think we just vastly inflate
[5097.15s - 5098.85s] what that word actually means.
[5098.85s - 5101.65s] And to me, when you look at the word love,
[5101.65s - 5102.65s] it's two things.
[5102.65s - 5105.53s] It's you admire something in someone else,
[5105.53s - 5107.85s] some quality, some characteristics,
[5107.85s - 5109.57s] something about them.
[5109.57s - 5111.93s] And you consider them, you have them in mind.
[5111.93s - 5114.57s] And if you admire somebody,
[5114.57s - 5115.81s] something about their values,
[5115.81s - 5117.33s] something about how they show up in life,
[5117.33s - 5120.89s] something about who they are, what they mean to you.
[5120.89s - 5123.73s] And you have them in mind, to your point,
[5123.73s - 5126.53s] sending a text, just to say I was just thinking about you,
[5126.53s - 5129.65s] making somebody a cup of coffee with the cashew milk
[5129.65s - 5131.41s] because that's what they care about.
[5131.41s - 5132.57s] That's actually an act of love.
[5132.57s - 5134.12s] It is.
[5134.12s - 5137.28s] And if we go all the way back to the janitors
[5137.28s - 5140.28s] in the hospital who say that they are healers,
[5140.28s - 5145.28s] because they believe that having a clean space
[5145.52s - 5148.52s] for families to gather, for people to heal
[5148.52s - 5153.60s] is a sacred thing to do for the healing process,
[5153.60s - 5158.11s] then you are demonstrating an act of love.
[5158.11s - 5159.59s] How do you think about love?
[5159.59s - 5162.59s] I don't think about love, such a beautiful and big question.
[5162.59s - 5163.95s] Because I feel like, you know,
[5163.95s - 5166.43s] we're coming out of this conversation
[5166.43s - 5168.59s] about how we block it,
[5168.59s - 5171.87s] because we're expecting it to be expressed in a certain way.
[5171.87s - 5174.51s] And that it is all around you.
[5174.51s - 5176.75s] And you're a person in my life
[5176.75s - 5179.91s] that you show up that way.
[5179.91s - 5182.55s] I mean, there's what you do,
[5182.55s - 5184.56s] which is your job.
[5184.56s - 5189.12s] And the things that you are doing
[5189.12s - 5192.39s] that is in service of the world,
[5192.39s - 5194.73s] but it's not who you are.
[5194.73s - 5197.01s] And my experience of you is somebody
[5197.01s - 5199.89s] who is the expression of love.
[5199.89s - 5201.25s] Thank you, Sophie.
[5201.25s - 5202.49s] That touches my heart.
[5207.82s - 5208.98s] I think what you just said,
[5208.98s - 5212.32s] there's even more interesting about blocking love.
[5212.32s - 5218.99s] If you still see your mom calling, that's a blessing.
[5219.31s - 5222.96s] If you still see your dad's name on your phone,
[5222.96s - 5227.15s] sending you a text, that's a blessing.
[5227.15s - 5228.71s] 10 years from now,
[5228.71s - 5232.47s] you're not gonna remember the meeting you were in.
[5232.47s - 5234.03s] 20 years from now,
[5234.03s - 5238.37s] you're not gonna remember the task you were doing.
[5238.37s - 5240.37s] That's how we block love.
[5240.37s - 5242.25s] We block love because when it's coming in,
[5242.25s - 5246.06s] when it's coming freely, when it's coming unlimitedly,
[5246.06s - 5248.10s] we don't know how to hold on to it.
[5248.10s - 5251.74s] There's this beautiful poem from India
[5251.74s - 5253.50s] that says,
[5253.50s - 5257.04s] when God wants to give us something,
[5257.04s - 5260.88s] how much can these two little hands hold on to?
[5260.88s - 5264.31s] And when things are taken away from us,
[5264.31s - 5267.54s] how much can these two little hands hold on to?
[5267.54s - 5272.54s] And it's this beautiful idea of God's ever-flowing love
[5273.80s - 5275.56s] that's unlimitedly there,
[5275.56s - 5278.57s] and we can just try to catch and hold whatever we can.
[5278.57s - 5279.53s] And at the same time,
[5279.53s - 5282.40s] in when something's going away,
[5282.40s - 5284.00s] there's an insignificance that we have
[5284.00s - 5286.61s] where we can't hold on to anymore.
[5286.61s - 5288.36s] So what do we do?
[5288.36s - 5293.78s] We pick up the call, we return it, we message back.
[5293.78s - 5295.18s] We don't block it by saying,
[5295.18s - 5297.78s] oh, they just keep connecting.
[5297.78s - 5299.70s] Oh, that person just keeps calling.
[5299.70s - 5300.94s] Oh, that person just,
[5300.94s - 5305.17s] the amount of people that are blocking love,
[5305.17s - 5306.85s] because they're thinking,
[5306.85s - 5309.89s] that person's needy or that person's desperate
[5309.89s - 5314.01s] or that person's not cool enough to be my friend
[5314.01s - 5317.65s] or that person's not interesting enough to be my friend.
[5317.65s - 5321.69s] I know so many people today that are leaving friendships
[5321.69s - 5323.37s] and relationships behind,
[5323.37s - 5326.01s] because the person's not cool enough, smart enough,
[5326.01s - 5328.21s] talented enough, whatever it is,
[5328.21s - 5330.41s] because when someone shows and wears their heart
[5330.41s - 5334.10s] on their sleeve, we see that as a weakness.
[5334.10s - 5338.02s] We believe that love is chasing someone
[5338.02s - 5341.66s] rather than wanting someone who never wants to leave.
[5341.66s - 5346.66s] We would rather chase, pursue and court someone
[5347.18s - 5350.34s] because we believe that love has to be earned
[5350.34s - 5352.82s] rather than receive it freely
[5352.82s - 5354.98s] from all of these people around us
[5354.98s - 5357.50s] who are giving it to us unlimitedly
[5357.50s - 5362.18s] because we think that love is valuable if it's rare.
[5362.18s - 5364.26s] We believe that love is valuable
[5364.26s - 5366.30s] if it's given in small doses.
[5366.30s - 5368.30s] If someone's holding it back a little,
[5368.30s - 5371.50s] it feels like power and that feels like love to us.
[5371.50s - 5373.54s] But that's not love, it's control.
[5373.54s - 5376.14s] That's not love, it's manipulation.
[5376.14s - 5378.70s] That's not a partnership, it's ownership.
[5378.70s - 5381.10s] So if you're looking for a relationship,
[5381.10s - 5383.38s] love should just flow freely.
[5383.38s - 5385.38s] Love is not measured, it's not calculated,
[5385.38s - 5388.50s] it's not counted, it's not some algorithm,
[5388.50s - 5393.50s] it's not a number, it's completely a free flowing energetic force
[5393.82s - 5396.38s] and it is in your life, it is flowing within you,
[5396.38s - 5400.70s] you are made of it, you are actually made of it
[5400.74s - 5402.82s] and it is flowing freely within you to you
[5402.82s - 5406.15s] at all times it's why you are alive.
[5406.15s - 5409.35s] But if you block it, it's like when the sun's out
[5409.35s - 5411.35s] and you turn the blinds down,
[5411.35s - 5416.35s] the sun is freely showering its rays onto every single home.
[5416.83s - 5418.55s] The sun does not discriminate,
[5418.55s - 5421.95s] the sun will freely give its sun to everyone.
[5421.95s - 5426.40s] But if you put the shades down, you're blocking it.
[5426.40s - 5427.24s] Don't do that.
[5428.23s - 5431.79s] There's so many people that feel isolated and lonely, Jay.
[5433.11s - 5435.19s] If somebody's listening and they're like,
[5435.19s - 5440.30s] the shades are down, Jay, and there aren't people in my life.
[5440.30s - 5443.14s] What is one thing somebody can do that recognizes
[5443.14s - 5446.28s] that the shades are drawn for whatever reason?
[5446.28s - 5449.60s] How do you start to crank it back up
[5449.60s - 5453.12s] and let all of that that is available to you?
[5453.12s - 5457.60s] Friendship, love, connection, possibility, hope,
[5457.60s - 5458.44s] all of it.
[5458.44s - 5460.56s] What's one thing that somebody could do?
[5460.56s - 5461.92s] Be that person.
[5461.92s - 5464.16s] Be the person to text someone, love.
[5464.16s - 5467.12s] Be the person to call in and check in on someone,
[5467.12s - 5468.76s] even if they don't check in on you.
[5468.76s - 5472.32s] Be the person who goes and helps someone with their groceries
[5472.32s - 5473.24s] because they need it.
[5473.24s - 5476.40s] Be the person who goes and gives love to others
[5476.40s - 5478.04s] even if they're not feeling it back
[5478.04s - 5480.96s] because that's the beautiful thing about love.
[5480.96s - 5484.40s] Love is not only experienced in receiving,
[5484.40s - 5485.88s] it's experienced in giving.
[5485.88s - 5488.52s] That's the most phenomenal thing about love
[5488.52s - 5492.08s] is that when you're giving someone something special,
[5492.08s - 5494.56s] you feel love just as much as they do.
[5494.56s - 5496.48s] Sometimes we feel it even more
[5496.48s - 5498.76s] than when we're receiving something, right?
[5498.76s - 5501.32s] There's this feeling of when you've done something
[5501.32s - 5504.32s] for someone you love, there's a joy in it.
[5504.32s - 5506.44s] You think about it, you said you love gardening.
[5506.44s - 5509.98s] Gardening is the best analogy for this.
[5509.98s - 5512.86s] There is no rose in the world
[5512.86s - 5516.02s] that grows the day you plant the seed.
[5516.02s - 5520.02s] It takes months, sometimes even years for a tree
[5520.02s - 5524.37s] to have a beautiful fruit or a beautiful flower.
[5524.37s - 5526.37s] And it takes a particular season.
[5526.37s - 5528.37s] Now, if you planted that seed
[5528.37s - 5530.37s] and said, why don't I have a fruit today?
[5530.37s - 5531.37s] It wouldn't make sense.
[5531.37s - 5533.60s] I'd look at you like you're crazy.
[5533.60s - 5535.60s] But that's what we do in love.
[5535.60s - 5538.98s] We plant the seed today and we want the fruit,
[5538.98s - 5541.98s] the flower and the shade today.
[5541.98s - 5545.98s] And we want the fruit, the flower and the shade today.
[5545.98s - 5551.68s] And the deepest form of love is something that Emerson said,
[5551.68s - 5556.78s] plant trees under whose shade you do not plan to sit.
[5556.78s - 5558.91s] And that's what you do.
[5558.91s - 5561.91s] You are helping so many people that you probably don't even know.
[5561.91s - 5564.97s] Hopefully they'll get to meet you one day and tell you,
[5564.97s - 5566.97s] Mal, I really hope that you get to hear it.
[5566.97s - 5568.97s] But there'll be so many people who never do.
[5568.97s - 5569.97s] But you're not doing it for that.
[5569.97s - 5572.97s] You're doing it because you're happy for trees to just exist
[5572.97s - 5575.97s] so that other people can get fruits and flowers and shade.
[5576.97s - 5579.97s] So let's not sit here and plant the seed today
[5579.97s - 5583.07s] and expect to eat the fruit today.
[5583.07s - 5585.07s] It doesn't work that way.
[5585.07s - 5587.07s] Plant the seed and keep planting the seeds.
[5587.07s - 5590.07s] And you will find decades from now.
[5590.07s - 5593.13s] There'll be someone who comes to you 25 years from now
[5593.13s - 5595.13s] and says, you did this one thing.
[5595.13s - 5597.13s] I love calling my teachers.
[5597.13s - 5598.13s] I love calling all teachers.
[5598.13s - 5600.13s] I'm really good friends with all the schools I went to.
[5600.13s - 5605.13s] I love calling professors, teachers, talking about them in interviews,
[5605.13s - 5607.13s] making them feel really embarrassed,
[5607.13s - 5610.13s] and just saying how much they changed my life and how much I love them.
[5610.13s - 5613.13s] Because I don't think they knew that then.
[5613.13s - 5617.13s] At that time, I was just a teenager who had teenage issues
[5617.13s - 5620.13s] and didn't care about teachers and probably, you know, whatever.
[5620.13s - 5621.13s] I was just a kid.
[5621.13s - 5623.13s] Now when I look back, I'm like, that teacher changed my life.
[5623.13s - 5624.13s] Let me tell them.
[5624.13s - 5627.29s] And that's a seed that they planted all those years ago.
[5627.29s - 5629.52s] So live for that.
[5629.52s - 5630.52s] You know, let's live for that.
[5630.52s - 5633.52s] Let's not live for this instant immediate love.
[5633.52s - 5635.74s] Who is a teacher from when you're a little?
[5635.74s - 5636.74s] Oh, gosh.
[5636.74s - 5637.74s] There's a couple.
[5637.74s - 5640.74s] So there's two that come to mind as soon as you say that.
[5640.74s - 5644.74s] One is Mr. Buckeridge, who was my art teacher.
[5644.74s - 5646.74s] And I loved art at school.
[5646.74s - 5650.74s] And actually, when I was 11 years old, my favorite subject was math
[5650.74s - 5652.74s] and my least favorite subject was art.
[5652.74s - 5655.74s] And when I went to high school, my favorite subject was art
[5655.74s - 5657.74s] and my least favorite subject was math.
[5657.74s - 5659.74s] And art I fell in love with because of this teacher.
[5659.74s - 5661.74s] There was something beautifully taught me.
[5661.74s - 5664.09s] And I really owe this to him.
[5664.09s - 5667.25s] Every time I presented a piece of work, he'd say to me,
[5667.25s - 5669.99s] why did you do it?
[5669.99s - 5671.99s] And at that time, I didn't have an answer.
[5671.99s - 5673.99s] I just did it because it looked good.
[5673.99s - 5674.99s] It looked cool.
[5674.99s - 5676.99s] My answer was that basic.
[5676.99s - 5677.99s] No, they look good together.
[5677.99s - 5678.99s] The colors match.
[5678.99s - 5679.99s] Oh, this looks cool.
[5679.99s - 5681.99s] It looks trendy.
[5681.99s - 5682.99s] And he'd never be satisfied with that.
[5682.99s - 5684.99s] He'd say, why did you do it?
[5684.99s - 5685.99s] And he kept asking me that.
[5685.99s - 5687.99s] And in the beginning, it would annoy me.
[5687.99s - 5688.99s] It would annoy me so much.
[5688.99s - 5689.99s] It'd be like, God, come on.
[5689.99s - 5690.99s] It looks good.
[5690.99s - 5691.99s] Who cares?
[5691.99s - 5692.99s] Give me an A.
[5692.99s - 5693.99s] Like you like the look of it.
[5693.99s - 5694.99s] He loved how it looked.
[5694.99s - 5695.99s] But he wouldn't.
[5695.99s - 5697.99s] He wasn't satisfied with that.
[5697.99s - 5699.12s] Say why?
[5699.12s - 5702.12s] I believe he's the reason I became such an intentional person.
[5702.12s - 5708.12s] Because he didn't allow me to place one color or dot or shape
[5708.12s - 5711.12s] next to something else if I could not explain why.
[5711.12s - 5714.12s] So today, if you come to my home, you come to my space,
[5714.12s - 5719.12s] everything from the moment I wake up to what I see to which book is
[5719.12s - 5723.12s] the bedside to what quote is next to my work desk.
[5723.12s - 5727.12s] Everything is meticulously intentionally planned out because he
[5727.12s - 5731.15s] never allowed me space to just do something because it looked good.
[5731.15s - 5735.15s] And that is the biggest gift he's given me because my life is so
[5735.15s - 5736.15s] intentional.
[5736.15s - 5737.15s] And he gave me that.
[5737.15s - 5738.15s] He was an art teacher.
[5738.15s - 5741.15s] I didn't know that at 11 to 18 when he was my teacher.
[5741.15s - 5743.15s] But I look back and I know it now.
[5743.15s - 5744.15s] Oh my God.
[5744.15s - 5748.15s] You're making me think of a teacher that I wish was still with us.
[5748.15s - 5753.15s] He was my middle school and high school math teacher.
[5753.15s - 5754.15s] I loved math.
[5754.15s - 5756.15s] Mr. Corps Glen core.
[5756.15s - 5757.15s] He was military guy.
[5757.15s - 5760.15s] So we had a crew cut and he always wore those like short
[5760.15s - 5764.15s] sleeve collared shirts and he had the protector and the glasses and
[5764.15s - 5765.15s] the whole thing.
[5765.15s - 5767.15s] And God, did I love math?
[5767.15s - 5772.15s] And he would always call people up to solve problems on the chalkboard.
[5772.15s - 5777.15s] And I can I can I can feel him like handing the chalk to me, right?
[5777.15s - 5779.15s] And so you would like solve the chalk things.
[5779.15s - 5780.15s] And then he'd coach it through it.
[5780.15s - 5782.15s] And then we'd talk about the problems.
[5782.15s - 5786.15s] But he had this thing that he would do where if somebody started to
[5786.15s - 5791.15s] struggle or get frustrated or feel really stupid, he would turn to the
[5791.15s - 5793.15s] class and say, what do I always say?
[5793.15s - 5798.18s] And we would all recite back her severance wins.
[5798.18s - 5803.18s] And he would take his chalk and he would write in all caps per
[5803.18s - 5804.18s] severance wins.
[5804.18s - 5805.18s] And they would underline it.
[5805.18s - 5808.18s] And then we'd be like, exclamation, exclamation.
[5808.18s - 5810.18s] And it's true.
[5810.18s - 5812.18s] It like seeped into my pores.
[5812.18s - 5818.47s] And I think more than anything else that I yes planted seeds.
[5818.47s - 5822.63s] But just kept going.
[5822.63s - 5828.63s] That per severance wins part of just don't quit.
[5828.63s - 5832.63s] Like that's part of it is just you're always if you open yourself
[5832.63s - 5839.56s] up to learning, to experimenting, to all of the abundance that
[5839.56s - 5841.56s] is available to you out there.
[5841.56s - 5842.56s] Yeah.
[5842.56s - 5843.56s] Eventually it comes.
[5843.56s - 5844.56s] I love that.
[5844.56s - 5845.56s] I love that.
[5845.56s - 5846.56s] You know, everyone should do that.
[5846.56s - 5848.56s] Everyone should reach out to a teacher.
[5848.56s - 5851.56s] If they can, if that person's still alive and just tell them,
[5851.56s - 5854.56s] send them an email, drop them a Facebook message, DM or whatever
[5854.56s - 5856.56s] access call the school if you have to.
[5856.56s - 5859.56s] Like it will just, it creates that energy in our life.
[5859.56s - 5860.56s] Yes.
[5860.56s - 5862.56s] Of gratitude and value in people and appreciation.
[5862.56s - 5863.56s] Yes.
[5863.56s - 5864.56s] And it will come back.
[5864.56s - 5865.56s] Yes.
[5865.56s - 5866.56s] It promise you will come back.
[5866.56s - 5868.56s] You could share this episode, this conversation with people that
[5868.56s - 5873.56s] you care about and tell them how much this conversation made you
[5873.56s - 5877.56s] think of them and realize how much you love them.
[5877.56s - 5879.56s] Like what a beautiful thing.
[5879.56s - 5882.56s] You know, another beautiful thing, Jay, is that I know that as
[5882.56s - 5886.56s] you're listening and as you've spent all this time together with Jay
[5886.56s - 5890.56s] and I today, you're thinking, God, I wish I could meet Jay.
[5890.56s - 5891.56s] And you're going on tour.
[5891.56s - 5893.56s] I am so excited.
[5893.56s - 5894.56s] Tell me about it.
[5894.56s - 5895.56s] We have never, ever.
[5895.56s - 5897.56s] So I went on a world tour two years ago.
[5897.56s - 5898.56s] But that was for a book.
[5898.56s - 5899.56s] But that was for a book.
[5899.56s - 5900.56s] Right.
[5900.56s - 5905.56s] This is the first time ever that we're taking the on purpose
[5905.56s - 5907.56s] podcast on tour.
[5907.56s - 5910.56s] And I promise you, the insights that we're going to share, the
[5910.56s - 5913.56s] wisdom that's going to be shared on this tour has not been shared
[5913.56s - 5916.56s] in any book, on any podcast.
[5916.56s - 5917.56s] It's so fresh.
[5917.56s - 5920.56s] And you're going to get to see the best part about it is you're
[5920.56s - 5923.56s] going to get to see me and my friends, people that I know
[5923.56s - 5929.75s] deeply on stage, 15 guests in 15 cities, different guests just
[5929.75s - 5931.75s] have a real conversation like this.
[5931.75s - 5936.75s] And the best part for your audience is you have kindly agreed
[5936.75s - 5941.75s] in the craziest schedule of all time to be my guest in Boston.
[5941.75s - 5942.75s] That's right.
[5942.75s - 5943.75s] Whang fear.
[5943.75s - 5944.75s] Right now.
[5944.75s - 5946.75s] The one thing that I can't wait.
[5946.75s - 5948.75s] You better get tickets because they're going to be gone.
[5948.75s - 5949.75s] They're probably already gone.
[5949.75s - 5950.75s] Yeah.
[5950.75s - 5951.75s] Yeah.
[5951.75s - 5952.75s] It's amazing.
[5952.75s - 5954.75s] So Jay Shetty.me forward slash tour.
[5954.75s - 5957.75s] We're doing 15 cities across North America to start.
[5957.75s - 5959.75s] You're so excited about it.
[5959.75s - 5960.75s] Why?
[5960.75s - 5966.84s] Because now you know having this incredible podcast.
[5966.84s - 5972.16s] There's an intimacy that you have with your listeners because we
[5972.16s - 5976.16s] know that everyone who's listening right now listens every day,
[5977.16s - 5979.16s] every week, all year round.
[5979.16s - 5984.64s] The connection I feel to my on purpose community is so deep
[5984.64s - 5986.64s] because it's all year round.
[5986.64s - 5990.24s] It's not the same as anything else.
[5990.24s - 5995.28s] We're in people's ears every single day, every single week.
[5995.28s - 5998.28s] Now imagine this person's usually on a hike.
[5998.28s - 5999.28s] All of you that are listening.
[5999.28s - 6000.28s] You're on a hike.
[6000.28s - 6001.28s] You're cooking.
[6001.28s - 6003.28s] You're in the car commuting to work.
[6003.28s - 6004.28s] You're maybe at work.
[6004.28s - 6005.28s] You're at the gym.
[6005.28s - 6006.28s] You're walking your dog.
[6006.28s - 6007.28s] Yeah.
[6007.28s - 6013.28s] Now we get to be in the same place at the same time in person.
[6013.28s - 6018.28s] And on top of that, you're now surrounded by people who do the same thing as
[6018.28s - 6019.28s] you.
[6019.28s - 6023.28s] So my favorite thing is not even just what we're going to do on stage.
[6023.28s - 6026.28s] It's the fact that people are going to walk out there as friends.
[6026.28s - 6027.28s] People are going to walk out.
[6027.28s - 6030.28s] They're connected to people that they've maybe never met.
[6030.28s - 6033.28s] I think people are going to walk out there with a future wife or husband or
[6033.28s - 6034.28s] husband.
[6034.28s - 6036.28s] Because that person is doing the same thing you're doing.
[6036.28s - 6042.34s] The collective consciousness of a space like that is unheard of.
[6042.34s - 6049.34s] There's very few places that people gather today with the same exact intention in
[6049.34s - 6050.34s] person.
[6050.34s - 6051.34s] It used to be there.
[6051.34s - 6053.34s] It doesn't exist anymore.
[6053.34s - 6054.34s] You go to a coffee shop.
[6054.34s - 6055.34s] Everyone's there for different reasons.
[6055.34s - 6056.34s] Someone's working.
[6056.34s - 6058.34s] Someone's wasting some time.
[6058.34s - 6059.34s] Someone's starting the day.
[6059.34s - 6060.34s] Someone's ending their day.
[6060.34s - 6062.34s] There's not a collective consciousness.
[6062.34s - 6063.34s] You go to an office.
[6063.34s - 6064.34s] Some people working from home.
[6064.34s - 6065.34s] Some people work from there.
[6065.34s - 6067.34s] Some people are there to pay the bills.
[6067.34s - 6069.34s] Some people are there because they're excited.
[6069.34s - 6071.34s] Different consciousness.
[6071.34s - 6077.60s] Everyone who listens to the Mel Robbins podcast or to on purpose is committed to
[6077.60s - 6083.60s] learning, listening and growing and committed to health, happiness and healing.
[6083.60s - 6086.43s] The energy in that room.
[6086.43s - 6089.97s] There's no other place you can go to that feels that way.
[6089.97s - 6090.97s] It doesn't exist.
[6090.97s - 6093.42s] It's really, really special.
[6093.42s - 6096.42s] That's why I'm so excited because collective consciousness doesn't work like
[6096.42s - 6097.42s] that anymore.
[6097.42s - 6101.42s] In the past, there's something beautiful that I'm writing about for my next book.
[6101.42s - 6104.42s] It's called the Third Space Theory.
[6104.42s - 6114.18s] This idea that a few decades ago, we all had three spaces that we lived in.
[6114.18s - 6115.56s] One was home.
[6115.56s - 6117.56s] One was work.
[6117.56s - 6119.60s] And one was church.
[6119.60s - 6124.36s] There was a place that you called home where you felt very safe and comfortable.
[6124.36s - 6128.36s] There was a place that you called work, which was very productive and effective.
[6128.36s - 6134.36s] And then there was a place that gave you the vision to reflect back on who you were at
[6134.36s - 6138.36s] home and who you were at work and how you could be better.
[6138.36s - 6142.49s] Slowly as time went on, that's Third Space disappeared.
[6142.49s - 6147.32s] So we had home and we had work because of the pandemic.
[6147.32s - 6149.32s] Work disappeared.
[6149.32s - 6151.32s] So now we only have home.
[6151.32s - 6154.55s] So at home, we eat where we're meant to sleep.
[6154.55s - 6156.55s] We sleep where we're meant to work.
[6156.55s - 6158.55s] And we work where we're meant to eat.
[6158.55s - 6165.55s] The energy of home has become so complicated that we don't know how to find a productive
[6165.55s - 6170.55s] energy, how to find a connected energy, how to find a safe, calm energy.
[6170.55s - 6174.93s] We've lost that podcast of the New Third Space.
[6174.93s - 6176.93s] That's where people are gathering.
[6176.93s - 6180.93s] But what if we can turn that into a place, a physical space where you can gather where
[6180.93s - 6185.93s] people come to listen, learn, to reflect back on their life, to want to be better, to
[6185.93s - 6186.93s] support each other.
[6186.93s - 6189.93s] And so there's such a need for us to do these things.
[6189.93s - 6191.93s] And I'm so glad you're on going on tour.
[6191.93s - 6193.93s] People can come and see you as well.
[6193.93s - 6196.93s] It's just, it's, it's so needed right now.
[6196.93s - 6200.06s] I love how you just laid that out.
[6200.06s - 6201.06s] It's true.
[6201.06s - 6203.06s] It's like the three legs of the stool, two of them are gone.
[6203.06s - 6207.06s] That's why everybody's so wobbly and trying to find their balance.
[6208.06s - 6213.06s] And, you know, I'm also excited because when you have these conversations, I always think
[6213.06s - 6220.06s] about that I'm taking a walk with you as you're listening and that today we have invited
[6220.06s - 6227.06s] my dear friend, Jay Shetty, on this metaphorical walk together on the road of life.
[6227.06s - 6230.06s] And, you know, I was curious, Jay, you've shared so much.
[6230.06s - 6235.06s] You've poured into us with such just grace and wisdom.
[6235.06s - 6242.50s] And, you know, I, I knew this was going to be extraordinary.
[6242.50s - 6253.59s] I am just blown away by the impact that this will make in the person's life who's listening.
[6253.59s - 6259.59s] The impact it's made in my life, how it has truly brought us closer.
[6259.59s - 6265.61s] I'm so excited for all the things that you're working on.
[6265.61s - 6273.61s] If there was one thing that you want the person who's listening to do, just one thing,
[6273.61s - 6281.77s] the most important thing to really focus on coming out of just how generous you have been
[6281.77s - 6284.64s] with all of us.
[6284.64s - 6286.64s] What is the one thing today?
[6286.64s - 6297.99s] The one thing is, if you're feeling stuck, I want you to ask yourself one question.
[6297.99s - 6305.95s] Life can either be a school, a hospital, a movie, or a mountain.
[6305.95s - 6312.78s] Ask yourself, if life feels like a school right now, what do I need to learn?
[6312.78s - 6316.78s] Because the same lessons will keep repeating until we learn them.
[6316.78s - 6322.78s] If you're feeling like you're caught in a spiral of the same thing after the same thing,
[6322.78s - 6328.16s] life is trying to teach you something, go to the school of life.
[6328.16s - 6330.16s] Sometimes life feels like a hospital.
[6330.16s - 6332.19s] There's something to heal.
[6332.19s - 6338.48s] If you feel in pain, if you feel held back, if you feel like you're not strong enough yet
[6338.48s - 6344.48s] to go out there and go after something, ask yourself, what do I need to heal and start healing?
[6344.48s - 6347.02s] Sometimes life feels like a movie.
[6347.02s - 6350.02s] Everything's kind of going in a great direction.
[6350.02s - 6353.34s] Pause and ask yourself, what do I need to experience?
[6353.34s - 6356.34s] Because this experience will also dissipate and disappear.
[6356.34s - 6360.14s] Let me really experience it.
[6360.14s - 6365.14s] And finally, for those who are already on their path, life can feel like a mountain.
[6365.14s - 6368.30s] Ask yourself, what do I need to climb?
[6368.30s - 6371.30s] What skill do I need to learn to climb better?
[6371.30s - 6378.30s] You're stuck because you haven't figured out whether life is a school, a hospital, a movie, or a mountain.
[6378.30s - 6384.30s] And as soon as you see the patterns, are you being questioned again and again to learn something?
[6384.30s - 6388.91s] Are you just feeling so much pain that you can't even bear the burden to move forward?
[6388.91s - 6390.91s] Then it's all about healing.
[6390.91s - 6392.91s] Are you living at the top of the world?
[6392.91s - 6397.93s] But time feels like it's moving too fast, immersing that experience.
[6397.93s - 6404.03s] And if you're building right now, build that skill so you can climb higher and faster.
[6404.03s - 6410.03s] You know, as you're listening, I want to point out something that just happened.
[6410.03s - 6413.06s] You probably saw it if you're watching on YouTube.
[6413.06s - 6421.06s] As Jay just shared that with you, what has been a wildly dreary and ugly day here in Boston shifted.
[6421.06s - 6429.06s] And sunlight came streaming in and lit you up like a spotlight from above.
[6429.06s - 6431.16s] Did you feel that?
[6431.16s - 6432.16s] You know what?
[6432.16s - 6435.37s] You're more present than I am.
[6435.37s - 6436.37s] I was so locked in.
[6436.37s - 6438.37s] I didn't feel it until you said it.
[6438.37s - 6440.37s] And I looked over and I'm like, wow.
[6440.37s - 6443.37s] It shows how present you are. That's beautiful. I love that.
[6443.37s - 6447.37s] Well, I was hanging on every word and I realized I'm in the movie.
[6447.37s - 6450.37s] And I really want to be present and experience it.
[6450.37s - 6454.37s] Jay Shetty, what are your parting words, my friend?
[6454.37s - 6457.66s] My parting words, I'm so grateful to you, Mal.
[6457.66s - 6465.97s] You know, I'm so grateful to you because you've just done this for so many years and given your heart.
[6465.97s - 6468.97s] And you are receiving everything that you deserve.
[6468.97s - 6471.97s] Everything that you're getting you deserve so deeply.
[6471.97s - 6476.97s] And it is so beautiful to witness your friends being honored.
[6476.97s - 6486.97s] And being adored and being loved because there's a sense that I know we both always have that to shift the world.
[6486.97s - 6489.58s] It's going to take a lot of us.
[6489.58s - 6492.25s] I'm going to have to work together.
[6492.25s - 6498.59s] And what I love about you is that you are always spotlighting your friends.
[6498.59s - 6500.59s] You're always showing up for your friends.
[6500.59s - 6503.59s] You're always supporting your friends behind the scenes and on camera.
[6503.59s - 6506.59s] And I'm just so grateful that you made time for me today.
[6506.59s - 6511.59s] I always say to people, my public life is amazing, but my private life is better.
[6511.59s - 6515.59s] And my private life is better because of people like you.
[6515.59s - 6521.81s] Because we get to have genuine relationships and see a deep, real relationship.
[6521.81s - 6523.81s] For years offline.
[6523.81s - 6525.81s] And they support everything online.
[6525.81s - 6530.81s] If someone's online life is better than their offline life, that's a really hard place to live.
[6530.81s - 6534.81s] And I'm so grateful that because of friends like you, I get to say the opposite.
[6534.81s - 6540.81s] Well, Jay, I think when things feel dark, the job in life is to glow.
[6540.81s - 6543.81s] And you've definitely taught me how to do that.
[6543.81s - 6544.81s] Thank you.
[6544.81s - 6546.81s] I want to give you a big hug too.
[6547.91s - 6548.91s] Thank you.
[6548.91s - 6549.91s] I want to give you a big hug.
[6549.91s - 6551.91s] I want to give you a big hug too.
[6551.91s - 6552.91s] I love you.
[6552.91s - 6553.91s] I love you too.
[6553.91s - 6554.91s] Really, really love you.
[6554.91s - 6555.91s] Yeah.
[6555.91s - 6556.91s] And thank you to all of you as well.
[6556.91s - 6564.80s] Like just all of you that are listening and watching right now, you're already on the path.
[6564.80s - 6566.80s] The fact that you're listening to Mel.
[6566.80s - 6567.80s] This is the path.
[6567.80s - 6569.80s] You don't have to start something new.
[6569.80s - 6571.80s] You don't have to suddenly figure it out.
[6571.80s - 6572.80s] You are figuring it out.
[6572.80s - 6573.80s] That's why you're here.
[6574.80s - 6580.80s] So please feel encouraged and fueled and connected knowing that you've already committed.
[6580.80s - 6582.80s] You're already showing up for yourself.
[6582.80s - 6584.80s] You've already invested in yourself.
[6584.80s - 6589.80s] The fact that you're here proves that you're already living the world that you want to
[6589.80s - 6590.80s] live in.
[6590.80s - 6592.80s] So don't feel like you've got to start something, figure it out.
[6592.80s - 6593.80s] Like that you're stuck.
[6593.80s - 6594.80s] You're already not stuck.
[6594.80s - 6595.80s] You're already moving.
[6595.80s - 6596.80s] If it was stuck, you wouldn't be here.
[6596.80s - 6599.80s] See that as building momentum and keep showing up.
[6599.80s - 6600.80s] Jay, thank you.
[6600.80s - 6601.80s] Thank you.
[6601.80s - 6602.80s] Thank you.
[6602.80s - 6606.80s] I want to thank you for listening and watching all the way to the end.
[6606.80s - 6610.90s] And what I'm really excited about is I agree with you, Jay.
[6610.90s - 6613.90s] That you're already moving into the right direction.
[6613.90s - 6619.90s] And everything that Jay poured into you and into me today as the sun is even getting brighter
[6619.90s - 6626.90s] in here in our studios in Boston is how you turn on that switch and you actually tap into
[6626.90s - 6631.90s] not only the light that's inside you, but you also we talked a lot about receiving.
[6631.90s - 6635.90s] That is a skill that I had to learn.
[6635.90s - 6641.90s] And when you focus on noticing what's around you and allowing it in, you will feel more
[6641.90s - 6642.90s] more loved.
[6642.90s - 6644.90s] You will feel better.
[6644.90s - 6645.90s] I just so believe that.
[6645.90s - 6650.90s] And I wanted to tell you, in case no one else does, that I love you and I believe in
[6650.90s - 6653.90s] you and I believe in your ability to create a better life.
[6653.90s - 6658.90s] And there is no doubt in my mind that based on everything that Jay just poured into you,
[6658.90s - 6659.90s] you actually will.
[6659.90s - 6661.03s] Alrighty.
[6661.03s - 6662.03s] I'll see you in a few days.
[6662.03s - 6666.03s] I'll be waiting to welcome you in to the very next episode, the moment you hit play.
[6666.03s - 6667.03s] I'll see you there.
[6667.03s - 6670.03s] You're definitely going to love this one and I'm going to be waiting to welcome you into
[6670.03s - 6672.03s] it the moment you hit play.
[6672.03s - 6673.03s] I'll see you there.
