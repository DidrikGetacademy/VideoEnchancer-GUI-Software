[0.00s - 1.87s] You're not stuck.
[1.87s - 5.63s] You're actually grieving a past version of yourself.
[5.63s - 9.63s] There's an identity, an idea, a mindset, a behavior,
[9.63s - 12.79s] an attitude that is keeping you held back.
[12.79s - 15.99s] So reality has moved on, but you've held on
[15.99s - 17.79s] and that's what's keeping you stuck.
[17.79s - 19.23s] And once you let go of that,
[19.23s - 21.99s] once you open and release your hands,
[21.99s - 24.03s] all of a sudden you feel free.
[24.03s - 27.43s] I am just blown away.
[27.43s - 28.91s] You can hate where you're at.
[28.91s - 29.75s] Yes.
[29.75s - 33.59s] You still gain all the skills you need for your future.
[33.59s - 37.55s] That mindset shift is how do I turn a place of misery
[37.55s - 40.23s] and pain and potentially suffering
[40.23s - 42.91s] into a place that becomes the launch pad of my life?
[42.91s - 45.75s] This is the place where I take off from.
[45.75s - 47.31s] When you're feeling stuck,

[47.31s - 49.71s] you might not be able to change what's around you.
[49.71s - 51.51s] So change how you view it.
[51.51s - 54.39s] There is no rose in the world
[54.39s - 56.87s] that grows the day you plant the seed.
[56.87s - 61.15s] It takes months, sometimes even years,
[61.15s - 65.39s] for a tree to have a beautiful fruit or a beautiful flower.
[65.39s - 68.23s] If you're feeling like you're caught in a spiral
[68.23s - 70.83s] of the same thing after the same thing,
[70.83s - 73.58s] life is trying to teach you something.
[73.58s - 75.14s] Go to the school of life.
[75.14s - 78.10s] Jay, I think when things feel dark,
[78.10s - 80.06s] the job in life is to glow.
[80.06s - 86.94s] And you've definitely taught me how to do that.
[86.94s - 88.54s] So before we get into this episode,
[88.54s - 90.30s] the team here at the Mel Robbins podcast
[90.30s - 91.78s] shared some data with me.
[91.78s - 93.46s] I love my data and research.

[135.62s - 136.62s] Hey, it's your friend Mel
[136.62s - 140.62s] and I am absolutely thrilled that you are here.
[140.62s - 144.50s] The conversation today is going to be extraordinary.
[144.50s - 146.94s] You know, it's always such an honor to spend time with you,
[146.94s - 148.22s] to be together with you.
[148.22s - 149.94s] And if you're a brand new listener,
[149.94s - 152.70s] I also want to take a moment and personally welcome you
[152.70s - 154.78s] to the Mel Robbins podcast family.
[154.78s - 155.94s] I'm thrilled that you're here
[155.94s - 158.06s] and I'm thrilled that you hit play
[158.06s - 160.26s] on this particular episode
[160.26s - 162.18s] because it's gonna be extraordinary.

[162.18s - 164.26s] It's gonna be exactly what you need to hear.
[164.26s - 166.74s] And because you hit play on this episode,
[166.74s - 168.62s] I already know something about you.
[168.62s - 171.82s] I know that you're someone who values your time
[171.82s - 175.82s] because you're making time to listen to a conversation
[175.82s - 179.70s] that will give you greater clarity, purpose and direction.
[179.70s - 182.78s] I also suspect that you're looking for some answers
[182.78s - 185.98s] for a way to make sense of what's going on in your life
[185.98s - 188.78s] and for guidance on how to move forward.
[188.78s - 190.54s] If someone sent you this episode,
[190.54s - 192.66s] I want to take a moment and point something out
[192.66s - 194.18s] that's really important.
[194.18s - 197.22s] You have people in your life who love you
[197.22s - 200.66s] and they want you to experience this conversation
[200.66s - 204.06s] because they are certain that what you're about to hear

[204.14s - 205.78s] will change your life.
[205.78s - 209.06s] It'll open you up to bigger possibilities.
[209.06s - 211.46s] And I want you to really listen today
[211.46s - 215.10s] and take in everything that you're about to learn
[215.10s - 219.43s] because if you do, time will slow down.
[219.43s - 222.03s] Your heart will soften.
[222.03s - 224.95s] Your guard will drop.
[224.95s - 227.68s] Your mind will expand
[227.68s - 231.72s] and you will know with every cell of your being
[231.72s - 234.00s] that what you're hearing today
[234.04s - 238.22s] is meant just for you because it is.
[238.22s - 241.86s] Jay Shetty is a person who is so hard to define
[241.86s - 244.78s] because the impact that he has on people's lives
[244.78s - 248.62s] transcends a label and it is truly global.
[248.62s - 251.46s] I consider Jay to be one of my closest friends,
[251.46s - 253.70s] especially in this business.
[253.70s - 255.94s] To the world, he's known as the host

[255.94s - 257.30s] of one of the most successful
[257.30s - 259.86s] and award-winning podcasts on the planet.
[259.86s - 262.78s] I'm talking about on purpose with Jay Shetty.
[262.78s - 265.30s] He is also the number one New York Times
[265.30s - 267.70s] best-selling author of two books,
[267.70s - 270.50s] Think Like a Monk and Eight Rules of Love,
[270.50s - 274.10s] which have been translated into over 47 languages.
[274.10s - 277.94s] Jay is also the chief purpose officer for calm,
[277.94s - 281.50s] the wildly, wildly popular meditation app.
[281.50s - 284.86s] He is a former monk who has reinvented himself
[284.86s - 287.02s] over and over again.
[287.02s - 289.82s] And his work and his life are gonna help you find
[289.82s - 292.42s] greater purpose and meaning in yours.
[292.42s - 296.54s] Please help me welcome the remarkable Jay Shetty
[296.54s - 298.46s] to the Mal Robbins podcast.
[298.46s - 303.06s] Oh my gosh, Jay Shetty in the house in Boston.

[303.06s - 307.90s] This is just, I have been waiting to welcome you in
[307.90s - 310.46s] here in person, Jay, my friend.
[310.46s - 311.78s] I'm so excited you're here.
[311.78s - 315.02s] Mel, you're the best in seeing your entire team
[315.02s - 317.38s] and your beautiful studio space.
[317.38s - 319.38s] I mean, it's incredible when you get to see
[319.38s - 322.26s] your friend's place of genius.
[322.26s - 325.38s] And I feel so lucky to be able to walk into it today.
[325.38s - 327.74s] And it truly is infused with all your energy.
[327.74s - 329.58s] So it's so beautiful to be here.
[329.58s - 332.38s] I'm so grateful to be on your incredible podcast,
[332.38s - 335.90s] the way you've been serving and showing up for people
[335.90s - 337.38s] and truly putting your heart there.
[337.38s - 338.46s] And I want people to know,
[338.46s - 341.94s] not just in the last 24 months for decades
[341.94s - 345.50s] of just showing up for people privately, personally,

[345.50s - 347.34s] publicly, it's incredible to watch
[347.34s - 348.34s] and I'm grateful to be your friend.
[348.34s - 349.18s] So thank you.
[349.18s - 350.82s] Oh, Jay, you're gonna make me cry.
[350.82s - 351.66s] Thank you.
[351.66s - 353.58s] So that, okay, I gotta pull myself together.
[353.58s - 357.54s] I would love to start by having you speak directly
[357.54s - 360.98s] to the person who is with us right now.
[360.98s - 363.86s] How might they feel different if they take everything
[363.86s - 366.62s] to heart that you're about to share with us today,
[366.62s - 369.42s] wisdom that you've learned, lessons that you want
[369.42s - 371.42s] to share, mistakes that you've made.
[371.42s - 374.05s] What could change about their life?
[374.05s - 377.23s] I believe if someone really listens today
[377.23s - 382.23s] and then reflects and then applies what we share,
[382.23s - 386.11s] I believe their mind will become their best friend,

[386.11s - 387.95s] not their worst enemy.
[387.95s - 392.95s] I believe that time will feel like it's full of possibilities,
[394.07s - 395.91s] not just full of pressure,
[395.91s - 398.76s] which is what we so often feel with time.
[398.76s - 403.87s] And I really believe that their life will feel clear
[403.87s - 407.14s] and less foggy and less undecided.
[407.14s - 410.78s] And they'll actually know their next move, their next step.
[410.78s - 412.18s] Maybe not the whole picture,
[412.18s - 415.46s] maybe not this big idea of the future
[415.46s - 418.90s] that we all seem to overwhelm ourselves with,
[418.90s - 421.54s] but they'll know their next step, their next move.
[421.54s - 423.98s] And they'll feel confident and secure
[423.98s - 425.02s] that it's the right step.
[425.02s - 428.42s] So I'd say that's what they'll get from listening today
[428.42s - 430.38s] and reflecting and applying.
[430.38s - 435.38s] I couldn't help but notice that you said listen and reflect

[436.26s - 439.60s] and then at the end, you said reflecting.
[439.60s - 443.20s] Why is that so important to not just listen and then do,
[443.20s - 445.60s] but to actually take that moment and reflect?
[445.60s - 447.04s] Well, here's the interesting thing, Mel.
[447.04s - 448.60s] I think what we don't realize
[448.60s - 453.60s] is that there's actually five steps from listening to change.
[453.60s - 454.44s] What?
[454.44s - 456.84s] Yeah, there's five in between, but they're very simple.
[456.84s - 459.60s] And if we actually follow them, we're guaranteed success.
[459.60s - 461.08s] So the first is learn.
[461.08s - 463.16s] The fact that people are listening to us today,
[463.16s - 465.56s] the fact that people follow you, they read your books,
[465.56s - 467.00s] they may listen to mine,
[467.00s - 469.36s] they get the opportunity to learn.
[469.36s - 470.20s] But what's the difference?
[470.20s - 471.72s] We know lots of people that learn,

[471.72s - 473.40s] but never get to change their life.
[473.40s - 474.24s] So what's going wrong?
[474.24s - 475.68s] What's the missing part?
[475.68s - 478.68s] After learning, we have to experiment.
[478.68s - 480.16s] You've got to try this out.
[480.16s - 482.36s] You may try it out tomorrow and it may not work.
[482.36s - 484.60s] You may try it out on Wednesday and it will work perfectly.
[484.60s - 486.12s] You may try out in a week
[486.12s - 487.28s] and then there'll be a little dip.
[487.28s - 489.00s] So experiment with it.
[489.00s - 491.56s] Don't feel like it's going to be perfect tomorrow.
[491.56s - 493.36s] Play with it, have fun with it.
[493.36s - 495.12s] And then the third step is perform.
[495.12s - 498.16s] Once you've experimented, you get into a groove.
[498.16s - 499.72s] You start to feel it working.
[499.72s - 502.00s] You start to notice it in your body.
[502.00s - 504.68s] Your mindset feels different when you wake up in the morning.

[504.68s - 508.04s] Now you don't have to do all the conscious stuff anymore.
[508.04s - 509.44s] It's kind of unconscious.
[509.44s - 511.88s] And then finally, there'll always be struggle
[511.88s - 514.00s] just before you're about to unlock
[514.00s - 515.36s] this new level of greatness.
[515.36s - 517.20s] And then finally, there's thrive.
[517.20s - 519.56s] So to me, that reflection process
[519.56s - 521.68s] is those three steps in between
[521.68s - 525.04s] of experimenting, performing and struggling.
[525.04s - 527.40s] It's the ability to try something out,
[527.40s - 528.76s] then reflect back and go,
[528.76s - 530.40s] wait, how could I have done that?
[530.40s - 531.96s] 1% different.
[531.96s - 533.72s] How could I have done that 2% different?
[533.72s - 534.92s] What do I need to shift?
[534.92s - 536.96s] And as soon as you start doing that,
[536.96s - 538.48s] you start enjoying reflection.
[538.48s - 540.48s] So reflection's not just in the mind.

[540.48s - 541.60s] It's something you're practicing.
[541.60s - 543.76s] It's something you're experimenting with.
[543.76s - 545.52s] I've never heard anybody explain it that way.
[545.52s - 546.36s] I love that.
[546.36s - 548.40s] Well, it makes so much sense because you're right.
[548.40s - 550.52s] Like I think you can hear an idea
[550.52s - 552.12s] and you can try it once.
[552.12s - 553.88s] And then if it doesn't feel the way you want it
[553.88s - 555.24s] to feel, most people stop.
[555.24s - 556.08s] Yes.
[556.08s - 557.56s] And I've never thought about the fact
[557.56s - 561.28s] that if you don't actually know that trying something
[561.28s - 563.28s] and then reflecting on what worked,
[563.28s - 565.32s] what didn't work, tweaking it, experimenting,
[565.32s - 567.64s] as you said, you're always going to stop.
[567.64s - 569.08s] Absolutely, absolutely.
[569.08s - 570.88s] And by the way, isn't it just the case,

[570.88s - 574.40s] Mel, that even something that you've done for years,
[574.40s - 576.80s] you still need to keep experimenting with it.
[576.80s - 578.60s] So just because something worked last year
[578.60s - 580.28s] doesn't mean it's going to work this year.
[580.28s - 582.00s] You've got to keep that process going
[582.00s - 584.24s] and that's what makes it fun and alive
[584.24s - 586.64s] and it doesn't become routine and monotonous.
[586.64s - 589.88s] And so I love reflection being in action.
[589.88s - 593.08s] You know, Jay, so many people look to you
[593.08s - 598.08s] because you have written just incredible blockbuster books.
[599.40s - 601.52s] You have millions and millions of followers.
[601.52s - 604.28s] Your podcast is a podcast I listen to.
[604.28s - 607.56s] Your podcast is a podcast that inspired me
[607.56s - 609.28s] to get into the podcasting space.
[609.28s - 610.80s] No, you're going to make me cry.
[610.80s - 611.92s] And so, no, I'm serious.

[611.92s - 614.72s] And so I think there are times in your life
[614.72s - 616.56s] and you've certainly felt this way
[616.56s - 620.80s] where you're really lost and unhappy and you feel stuck
[620.80s - 622.12s] and I know you've been there.
[622.12s - 623.68s] And so I would love to just,
[623.68s - 626.20s] before we kind of dig into specifics
[626.20s - 629.48s] and unpack some of the lessons from your life,
[629.48s - 631.12s] what would you say to somebody
[631.12s - 633.88s] who really does feel kind of lost right now
[633.88s - 636.44s] or stuck or doesn't know what their next move is?
[636.44s - 639.12s] And how do you want the person who feels that way
[639.12s - 641.68s] to think about that moment
[641.68s - 646.06s] where you feel like you don't know what to do next?
[646.06s - 647.46s] I love what you asked there because you said,
[647.46s - 650.26s] how would you like someone to think about that moment?
[650.26s - 652.22s] What I'd like people to remember

[652.22s - 654.45s] is that you're not stuck.
[654.45s - 658.58s] You're actually grieving a past version of yourself.
[658.58s - 661.70s] So there's a part of you that's died
[661.70s - 664.58s] that actually you left behind a long time ago,
[664.58s - 666.90s] but there's a part of you that still misses it.
[666.90s - 668.34s] You still want things to be the same.
[668.34s - 670.26s] You still want things to be that way
[670.26s - 672.58s] and that keeps pulling you back.
[672.58s - 674.06s] And that's actually blocking you
[674.06s - 675.38s] from making the next move.
[675.38s - 678.22s] It's stopping you because life used to be this way
[678.22s - 679.90s] or life used to feel this way.
[679.90s - 683.54s] And so we're stuck not because we don't know what to do next.
[683.54s - 685.50s] We're stuck because there's a part of us
[685.50s - 687.90s] that wants to hold on to what we have here.
[687.90s - 690.46s] There's a beautiful Zen teaching that says,

[690.46s - 694.19s] what's holding you back is what you're holding onto.
[694.19s - 696.51s] And I think if people think about that for a second,
[696.51s - 700.15s] what are you holding onto that's holding you back?
[700.15s - 703.67s] What are you clinging onto that's keeping you stuck?
[703.67s - 707.71s] There's an identity, an idea, a mindset, a behavior,
[707.71s - 711.15s] an attitude that is keeping you held back.
[711.15s - 712.55s] And once you let go of that,
[712.55s - 715.35s] once you open and release your hands,
[715.35s - 717.31s] all of a sudden you feel free.
[717.31s - 719.43s] So what identity, what habit, what mindset,
[719.43s - 724.47s] what expectation are you letting yourself be held back by
[724.51s - 726.07s] that if you were to let go of,
[726.07s - 728.62s] you could easily move forward?
[728.62s - 729.90s] Can you give an example?
[729.90s - 730.74s] You know what I'm saying?
[730.74s - 733.02s] Because I think I understand what you're saying.

[733.02s - 735.54s] Like I'm trying to think about a scenario
[735.54s - 740.18s] where let's say somebody is at a moment in their life
[740.18s - 741.54s] where there's a change.
[741.54s - 743.74s] You have gone through a breakup
[743.74s - 746.58s] or maybe you've raised your kids and they've launched
[746.58s - 749.06s] and now you're trying to figure out your next chapter.
[749.06s - 752.30s] Maybe you just lost your job.
[752.30s - 754.82s] And now you're like, oh my God, what do I do?
[754.82s - 757.26s] What are the kinds of things that people hold on to
[757.26s - 761.18s] that you may not realize this is what you're actually holding on to?
[761.18s - 762.26s] Yes.
[762.26s - 765.34s] So all three examples you gave apply.
[765.34s - 767.94s] If you've raised your kids and they've left the house,
[767.94s - 769.42s] there's a part of you that misses
[769.42s - 771.90s] what the home felt like with their energy.
[771.90s - 774.34s] And now you spend all your day thinking about

[774.34s - 775.70s] all the memories in the corners.
[775.70s - 778.42s] You look in this corner and you remember your child growing up,
[778.42s - 780.78s] you look in this corner and you remember Christmas dinner,
[780.78s - 782.10s] you look at this place.
[782.10s - 784.06s] So you're constantly surrounding yourself
[784.06s - 787.06s] with an identity that no longer exists.
[787.06s - 790.34s] So you don't have the time or the energy or the presence
[790.34s - 792.66s] to be able to even think about what comes next
[792.66s - 795.10s] because there's a part of you that still feels affected.
[795.10s - 797.34s] If you go through a relationship breakup,
[797.34s - 800.46s] you keep looking at pictures of when you went on vacation.
[800.46s - 802.30s] You keep looking at the pictures
[802.30s - 804.02s] of when you had your first date.
[804.02s - 808.86s] You keep looking at the memories of maybe it's a clothing,
[808.86s - 810.66s] piece of clothing, maybe it's an item at home,

[810.66s - 811.86s] whatever you're surrounded by.
[811.86s - 815.14s] So you're still living as if you're still dating that person
[815.14s - 816.54s] in your mind.
[816.54s - 819.66s] And so that's all holding on to something
[819.66s - 822.74s] that is an identity that's already moved on in life.
[822.74s - 824.38s] Your kids have already moved on,
[824.38s - 827.26s] they're at college or they're getting engaged.
[827.26s - 829.78s] Your ex has already moved on,
[829.78s - 832.94s] they're in a new relationship or they're alone.
[832.94s - 836.26s] So reality has moved on, but you've held on
[836.26s - 838.02s] to the piece of clothing, the memory, the photo,
[838.02s - 839.34s] the whatever it may be.
[839.34s - 841.22s] And that's what's keeping you stuck.
[841.22s - 844.46s] So my question to everyone is, what is that thing for you?
[844.46s - 846.46s] And how do you learn to release it?
[846.46s - 847.34s] That's the focus.
[847.34s - 848.58s] I think we think we're stuck

[848.58s - 850.18s] because we don't know what to do next.
[850.18s - 852.26s] No, we're stuck because we're still holding on
[852.26s - 854.02s] to what's behind us.
[854.02s - 856.90s] And as soon as you release it, you propel yourself forward.
[856.90s - 857.78s] Have you ever felt that before
[857.78s - 859.38s] and you're holding on to something really tight?
[859.38s - 862.02s] If you let go of it, all of a sudden you feel momentum.
[862.02s - 864.38s] Momentum doesn't come from knowing where you're going.
[864.38s - 867.30s] It comes from knowing that I don't want to be here anymore.
[867.30s - 872.30s] That is so important because so many people stay where they are
[872.50s - 875.18s] because they don't know where they want to go next.
[875.18s - 878.82s] And I always say, well, actually, if you can be honest
[878.82s - 881.02s] with yourself and say, I just don't like how my life feels
[881.02s - 883.98s] anymore, you're already moving in a new direction

[883.98s - 885.62s] because you're moving away from what's not working.
[885.62s - 888.02s] I have one more example to give you
[888.02s - 891.58s] because what you just said was brilliant.
[892.58s - 901.21s] You have this ability, Jay, to just take wisdom, philosophy, psychology
[901.21s - 905.77s] and make it so immensely obvious that I both feel inspired
[905.77s - 909.37s] and sort of like an idiot that I didn't see it myself and I'm charged.
[909.37s - 911.93s] But no, I have one more example to give you
[911.93s - 914.33s] about this feeling of being stuck
[914.33s - 917.05s] because there are so many people
[917.05s - 919.69s] that have artistry inside themselves,
[919.85s - 921.81s] whether it's wanting to start a YouTube channel
[921.81s - 924.81s] or it's wanting to become a singer
[924.81s - 928.97s] or it's wanting to express themselves on social media
[928.97s - 933.25s] or it's wanting to learn how to market themselves better on social media.

[933.25s - 938.77s] And yet there is so much resistance to putting yourself out there.
[938.77s - 944.37s] And so in this paradigm where we're talking about holding on to something
[944.37s - 947.17s] and grieving who you used to be,
[947.21s - 953.21s] if somebody is actively fighting against their deep internal desire
[953.21s - 956.13s] to start putting themselves out there in a new chapter,
[956.13s - 959.17s] whether it's marketing a business or starting a YouTube channel
[959.17s - 962.49s] or performing and singing on whatever it may be,
[962.49s - 964.73s] what is it that you're holding on to?
[964.73s - 969.13s] It's the identity and the reputation that that identity is built.
[969.13s - 970.25s] OK, same more about that.
[970.25s - 973.65s] Yes. So it's saying, well, I'm a teacher.
[973.65s - 976.53s] I can't be a social media creator.
[976.53s - 978.81s] I'm a teacher. That's what my friends know me as.
[978.81s - 980.65s] That's not what my students know me as.

[980.65s - 983.69s] That's what my parents know me as.
[983.69s - 985.09s] That's what my kids know me as.
[985.09s - 988.25s] How can I be a teacher and be a social media creator?
[988.25s - 990.65s] It's not possible. Oh, I'm a nurse.
[990.65s - 993.41s] How can I be a nurse and a podcaster?
[993.41s - 994.45s] That can't be the case.
[994.45s - 996.09s] What do I have to offer? I'm a nurse.
[996.09s - 999.53s] And by the way, that's what everyone in my social circle knows me as.
[999.53s - 1003.25s] So now if I record a podcast, they're going to look at me and think,
[1003.25s - 1004.97s] wait, what does she have to say?
[1005.01s - 1007.01s] What are you going to teach the world?
[1007.01s - 1007.93s] Oh, I'm a mom.
[1007.93s - 1010.37s] I can't be a mom and own a TikTok shop.
[1010.37s - 1011.37s] I don't know how to do that.
[1011.37s - 1012.81s] I didn't go to business school.
[1012.81s - 1014.53s] I didn't. So this is what we do.

[1014.53s - 1020.65s] And the real reason is because our social circle has validated or at least
[1020.65s - 1023.33s] approved that current position.
[1023.33s - 1025.97s] Everyone in our social circle knows what that means.
[1025.97s - 1028.61s] They recognize it and they understand it.
[1028.61s - 1032.09s] As soon as we do something that people don't understand,
[1032.09s - 1034.69s] we're scared that they're not going to like us.
[1034.69s - 1037.25s] And as soon as we think they're not going to like us for doing something
[1037.25s - 1040.81s] they don't understand, we leave behind what we love.
[1040.81s - 1043.97s] Because we say, well, I can't do it if they're going to misunderstand me.
[1043.97s - 1045.93s] I can't do it if they're going to dislike me.
[1045.93s - 1048.61s] I have so many friends right now, Mel, honestly,
[1048.61s - 1051.32s] that are scared to put out a video
[1051.32s - 1054.96s] because they feel the pressure from their own friends.

[1054.96s - 1056.92s] People are not feeling pressure from the world.
[1056.92s - 1060.12s] People are usually not worried about the comments that will come many years
[1060.12s - 1061.88s] into being a creator.
[1061.96s - 1064.92s] It's the people around us that were most worried about.
[1064.92s - 1068.60s] And so the only way we let go of that is recognizing
[1068.60s - 1071.00s] and building this identity and insight
[1071.00s - 1073.88s] that I can be a teacher and a creator.
[1073.88s - 1076.40s] I can be a nurse and a podcaster.
[1076.40s - 1079.44s] I can be a mom and own an online business.
[1079.44s - 1083.56s] I can be two things at once and I don't need anyone else's permission.
[1083.56s - 1085.48s] And by the way, when I pull it off,
[1085.48s - 1087.44s] even then they won't understand.
[1087.44s - 1089.20s] So it was never about them understanding.
[1089.20s - 1091.44s] It was always about me focusing on what I love.

[1092.64s - 1095.56s] You know, I know that I've had like so many career changes.
[1095.56s - 1100.28s] I sometimes feel like I'm a cover band for ABBA doing costume changes.
[1100.28s - 1101.44s] Like it's not a resume.
[1101.44s - 1103.40s] It's like a chooser on adventure.
[1103.40s - 1106.68s] But you have had so many twists and turns in your career.
[1106.68s - 1111.04s] You literally went from university to a massive like consulting job
[1111.04s - 1114.72s] to pursuing like spiritual training as a monk
[1114.72s - 1116.92s] to then deciding, having an epiphany.
[1116.92s - 1120.24s] And at every one of those moments,
[1120.24s - 1124.40s] there was that pressure that you're talking about
[1124.40s - 1127.04s] where you have to make a call
[1127.04s - 1131.44s] that who you are and how you're living your life no longer feels right.
[1131.44s - 1135.68s] And then you, but you have always made the turn.

[1135.68s - 1140.00s] And so can you just like quickly kind of tell us a few of those moments
[1140.00s - 1142.80s] so that the person listening understands
[1142.80s - 1144.24s] that at any single moment,
[1144.24s - 1147.48s] you are literally one decision away
[1147.48s - 1150.60s] from turning your life in a different direction
[1150.60s - 1154.08s] and talk a little bit about what holds you back
[1154.08s - 1155.76s] when that resistance shows up.
[1155.76s - 1158.24s] Like, well, I can't leave a consulting job.
[1158.24s - 1159.40s] Thank you for saying that.
[1159.40s - 1164.68s] And the idea is everyone needs to become a professional quitter, right?
[1164.68s - 1167.82s] It's like we need to get really good at quitting.
[1167.82s - 1171.60s] And as I'm listening to you, I'm thinking back to,
[1171.60s - 1175.56s] I remember when I decided to become a monk,
[1175.56s - 1178.42s] pretty much no one around me understood why.

[1178.42s - 1181.76s] I remember when I decided to leave the monastery,
[1181.76s - 1185.35s] pretty much everyone around me didn't understand why.
[1185.35s - 1189.53s] When I decided to get a job in consulting after being a monk,
[1189.53s - 1191.90s] people were like, why?
[1191.90s - 1195.10s] When I decided to leave my successful consulting job
[1195.10s - 1197.50s] to try and make videos online,
[1197.50s - 1199.78s] people were like, why are you doing that?
[1199.78s - 1202.22s] Then when those videos became successful
[1202.22s - 1205.18s] and I decided to launch a podcast,
[1205.18s - 1209.74s] I had three podcast production companies tell me,
[1209.74s - 1211.74s] Jay, people like listening to you for four minutes.
[1211.74s - 1213.58s] No one wants to listen to you for an hour.
[1213.58s - 1215.22s] Don't launch a podcast.
[1215.22s - 1216.90s] So we launched a podcast anyway.
[1216.90s - 1218.90s] And thanks to the millions of people that listen to you,

[1218.90s - 1221.58s] that listen to us, that know us, that became a success.
[1221.58s - 1225.58s] So I always listen to people, not the executives in the room.
[1225.58s - 1227.82s] Then I wanted to launch a book, Mel,
[1227.82s - 1229.34s] and I went to launch a book
[1229.34s - 1232.22s] and 14 out of 17 imprints told me,
[1232.22s - 1234.10s] don't call it think like a monk,
[1234.10s - 1236.50s] because no one wants to think like a monk.
[1236.50s - 1238.38s] Five years later, the books sold millions of copies.
[1238.38s - 1240.96s] Again, thanks to those people,
[1240.96s - 1242.84s] not the people in the room.
[1242.84s - 1244.20s] Why am I sharing all of that?
[1244.20s - 1247.88s] Because I didn't know what the future held.
[1247.88s - 1250.00s] It's not that I had a really clear view
[1250.00s - 1252.12s] of exactly where I was going or that
[1252.12s - 1254.36s] when I left the monastery, I knew I'd be here today

[1254.36s - 1256.68s] or that when we launched a podcast, I knew I'd be here.
[1256.68s - 1258.88s] And I want to get that thought out of people's heads,
[1258.88s - 1261.88s] that if I don't have the full life mapped out
[1261.88s - 1264.80s] and planned out that I can't take the first step,
[1264.80s - 1267.24s] because I don't think I've ever known where my life's going.
[1267.24s - 1269.52s] And so this whole idea that you have to have everything
[1269.52s - 1271.84s] figured out before you take your first step
[1271.84s - 1273.60s] is the biggest lie we've been told.
[1273.60s - 1275.92s] This idea that if you don't have a clear vision,
[1275.92s - 1277.24s] you don't know where you're going.
[1277.24s - 1279.00s] It's the biggest lie we've been told.
[1279.00s - 1283.16s] How could anyone possibly have every step mapped out?
[1283.16s - 1285.84s] Tell me one person that we know in the world,
[1285.84s - 1287.80s] anyone you look up to, that could tell you

[1287.80s - 1291.08s] they meticulously knew every single step they didn't.
[1291.08s - 1292.40s] But they took that first step.
[1292.40s - 1294.04s] And I think that's what's holding us back
[1294.04s - 1296.56s] is this idea that I have to know everything
[1296.56s - 1298.64s] before I do one thing.
[1298.64s - 1299.68s] What is the one thing though?
[1299.68s - 1301.88s] Because I think that's the thing that's confounding
[1301.88s - 1305.60s] until you actually figure out the riddle in life, right?
[1305.60s - 1307.56s] It's sort of like you can't explain to somebody
[1307.56s - 1309.96s] what it feels like to be married
[1309.96s - 1312.08s] until you've done it.
[1312.08s - 1312.92s] Yes.
[1312.92s - 1317.08s] You can't explain to somebody how shockingly
[1317.08s - 1318.96s] simple things can be
[1318.96s - 1322.32s] until you've learned how to push through your own resistance
[1322.32s - 1324.40s] to the things that you're interested in

[1324.40s - 1327.20s] and curious about experimenting with or trying.
[1327.20s - 1330.12s] And so for somebody that's never even considered
[1330.12s - 1333.08s] a possibility for themselves beyond consulting
[1333.08s - 1335.36s] or beyond where they're at right now
[1335.36s - 1337.56s] or beyond the major that they had
[1337.56s - 1340.14s] or beyond the city that they live in,
[1340.14s - 1341.66s] what is that first step?
[1341.66s - 1346.06s] And is there a way if you're not even in touch
[1346.06s - 1349.38s] with what it feels like to be pulled towards something new
[1349.38s - 1351.34s] to identify it in yourself?
[1351.34s - 1352.66s] Because I think that's one of the things
[1352.66s - 1353.90s] that you do for people.
[1353.90s - 1357.58s] You help people see a bigger possibility for themselves.
[1357.58s - 1360.34s] And it took me a long time
[1360.34s - 1364.06s] to go from simply surviving and trying to pay bills
[1364.06s - 1365.70s] and get through the day

[1365.70s - 1370.70s] to understanding that there's a different way to wake up
[1371.42s - 1374.26s] and be tapped into the signals
[1374.26s - 1377.02s] and the energetic things that pull you
[1377.02s - 1378.70s] in different directions.
[1378.70s - 1380.66s] Because I think that's what you're talking about
[1380.66s - 1383.90s] when you say all you need to do is take one step.
[1383.90s - 1385.19s] Yes.
[1385.19s - 1388.39s] The step I'd say in the most practical way
[1388.39s - 1390.43s] to make it really, really simple for people
[1390.43s - 1393.71s] and get away from any philosophical idea
[1393.71s - 1397.23s] is it's actually not about falling in love
[1397.23s - 1400.43s] with something new or finding something else.
[1400.43s - 1402.99s] It's about extracting and learning
[1402.99s - 1406.27s] every possible thing from where you are right now.
[1406.27s - 1407.47s] Whatever job you're in.
[1407.47s - 1408.47s] But I don't want to do that, Jay,

[1408.47s - 1409.31s] because I hate my bad day.
[1409.31s - 1411.47s] But that is the thing.
[1411.47s - 1412.95s] You can hate where you're at.
[1412.95s - 1413.79s] Yes.
[1413.79s - 1417.63s] And still gain all the skills you need for your future.
[1417.63s - 1418.79s] When I was a consultant,
[1418.79s - 1420.43s] I knew I did not want to be a consultant
[1420.43s - 1421.47s] for the rest of my life.
[1421.47s - 1423.67s] But I learned so many incredible skills
[1423.67s - 1426.67s] from consulting that are so useful today.
[1426.67s - 1428.99s] Whether it's negotiation, whether it's communication,
[1428.99s - 1430.43s] whether it's presentation,
[1430.43s - 1432.19s] whether it's connecting with clients,
[1432.19s - 1434.27s] whatever it may be, there were so many skills.
[1434.27s - 1436.11s] If you're working in a school, I promise you,
[1436.11s - 1438.51s] there are so many skills in that school
[1438.51s - 1440.83s] that are available that if you start learning,

[1440.83s - 1442.91s] all of a sudden that place you hate
[1442.91s - 1444.79s] becomes a place that becomes a stepping stone
[1444.79s - 1445.79s] for your next step.
[1445.79s - 1447.95s] So is there a mindset shift?
[1447.95s - 1449.63s] Like from, I hate this dread,
[1449.63s - 1451.71s] like there've been times in my life
[1451.71s - 1454.39s] where I literally, you're heading to work.
[1454.39s - 1457.79s] You're just like, I do not want to walk through the door
[1457.79s - 1460.51s] and actually have to be there today.
[1460.51s - 1462.87s] So is there a mindset shift
[1462.87s - 1467.19s] that you would advise us to just hold onto?
[1467.19s - 1468.03s] Yes.
[1468.03s - 1472.35s] Because it shifts the experience of being where you are.
[1472.35s - 1474.07s] What is that mindset shift?
[1474.07s - 1476.71s] If you're going to spend eight to nine hours,
[1476.71s - 1479.71s] maybe more at work every day,

[1479.71s - 1482.71s] it's not great to walk in and think that for nine hours
[1482.71s - 1485.95s] a day, your mind is programming your thoughts
[1485.95s - 1487.55s] to say, I hate being here.
[1487.55s - 1488.63s] I don't want to be here.
[1488.63s - 1489.95s] I can't wait to get out
[1489.95s - 1492.71s] because you've wasted nine hours of your day
[1492.71s - 1494.83s] that could be used in building the next thing.
[1494.83s - 1498.11s] So the mindset shift is, I do hate being here.
[1498.11s - 1499.19s] I'm going to accept that.
[1499.19s - 1500.23s] I'm going to acknowledge that.
[1500.23s - 1501.99s] I'm not going to lie to myself,
[1501.99s - 1505.47s] but I'm going to take everything I possibly can
[1505.47s - 1509.83s] from this opportunity because it is a part of my story.
[1509.83s - 1512.27s] And it is such a powerful part of my story
[1512.27s - 1514.43s] because this only makes the story better.
[1514.43s - 1516.67s] I'm going to learn from a place that I hate

[1516.67s - 1519.91s] and I'm going to learn everything I possibly can.
[1519.91s - 1521.63s] And so that mindset shift is,
[1521.63s - 1526.31s] how do I turn and transform a place of misery and pain
[1526.31s - 1528.99s] and potentially suffering into a place
[1528.99s - 1530.95s] that becomes the launch pad of my life?
[1530.95s - 1532.91s] And all of a sudden now you're walking into work
[1532.91s - 1535.47s] thinking, oh, this is a launch pad.
[1535.47s - 1536.99s] Oh, wait a minute, this is a step.
[1536.99s - 1539.87s] This is the place where I take off from
[1539.87s - 1543.31s] rather than, oh, this is a place that's keeping me in prison.
[1543.31s - 1545.71s] And I think that's the switch that people need to make
[1545.71s - 1548.75s] because if you're always looking for it outside of work,
[1548.75s - 1550.87s] you're only giving yourself two hours in the evening,
[1550.87s - 1553.47s] maybe an hour if you're lucky after you've done the chores,

[1553.47s - 1555.71s] put the kids to bed, wash the dishes.
[1555.71s - 1557.83s] So why not use those eight to nine hours
[1557.83s - 1559.47s] to build skills, to build confidence,
[1559.47s - 1562.19s] to build security that you have available to you?
[1562.19s - 1563.75s] Well, you know what else I hear?
[1563.75s - 1564.59s] I hear trust.
[1564.59s - 1565.43s] Yes.
[1565.43s - 1567.99s] Because I think a lot of times, at least me personally,
[1567.99s - 1570.51s] when I've felt very stuck,
[1570.51s - 1574.51s] there was this intense feeling like I was in the wrong place
[1574.51s - 1576.51s] which then creates resistance.
[1576.51s - 1580.43s] And what you just did is by saying,
[1580.43s - 1582.19s] if I'm going to spend eight hours here,
[1582.19s - 1583.71s] then I'm going to get everything I can out of it
[1583.71s - 1587.19s] because I trust that by doing that,
[1587.19s - 1589.95s] I'll actually find the next thing.

[1589.95s - 1592.23s] There's a beautiful book which talks
[1592.23s - 1597.07s] about how really we find our purpose through sampling.
[1597.07s - 1598.43s] And when I think of the word sampling,
[1598.43s - 1603.11s] the way I describe it as is collecting and connecting.
[1603.11s - 1606.91s] You are collecting stories, experiences,
[1606.91s - 1611.63s] skills and ideas in every job you work in.
[1611.63s - 1615.67s] And one day after collecting for many, many years,
[1615.67s - 1620.07s] you will connect the dots of all of those different skills,
[1620.07s - 1622.39s] of all of those different experiences.
[1622.39s - 1624.63s] And that's when everything falls into place.
[1624.63s - 1626.71s] But if you don't collect in the first place,
[1626.71s - 1628.19s] there's nothing to connect.
[1628.19s - 1630.71s] It's not about finding and discovering something.
[1630.71s - 1632.27s] It's collecting along the way.
[1632.27s - 1633.99s] You're collecting little jigsaw pieces.

[1633.99s - 1636.19s] And then one day you spread them out and you put them down
[1636.19s - 1638.31s] and you start putting the pieces out and they all fit.
[1638.31s - 1640.63s] And you go, oh my gosh, I can't believe they connected.
[1640.63s - 1642.31s] When I look back in my life and I think,
[1642.31s - 1645.27s] I'm as much a consultant as I am among,
[1645.27s - 1647.11s] as I am a media person,
[1647.11s - 1649.35s] all of those things are really valuable parts of me.
[1649.35s - 1651.31s] And it goes back to the point I was making earlier,
[1651.31s - 1653.35s] I can't be a nurse and a content creator.
[1653.35s - 1654.63s] I can't be this and that.
[1654.63s - 1657.43s] Well, you can because that is your superpower.
[1657.43s - 1659.87s] Your superpower is that you did what you did
[1659.87s - 1660.99s] in the past and what you do now.
[1661.07s - 1662.75s] And by the way, you already are those things.
[1662.75s - 1663.75s] You already are those things,

[1663.75s - 1664.67s] whether you like it or not.
[1664.67s - 1668.58s] And maybe that's the whole point,
[1668.58s - 1670.26s] that you already are those things,
[1670.26s - 1672.14s] which is why you feel haunted
[1672.14s - 1676.86s] when you are in a chapter in your life that is over
[1676.86s - 1679.70s] and it's time for you to move toward the next thing
[1679.70s - 1680.98s] that's already a part of you.
[1680.98s - 1682.94s] And the reason why you know it's already a part of you
[1682.94s - 1684.74s] is because you actually feel pulled
[1684.74s - 1688.02s] to make YouTube videos or pulled to go back to graduate school
[1688.02s - 1691.42s] or pulled to be in a different relationship.
[1691.42s - 1694.66s] And I think this all goes back to college and school
[1694.66s - 1696.86s] in the sense that we were all forced to think
[1696.86s - 1698.54s] you had to pick one thing.
[1698.54s - 1700.42s] Your whole life, you were trained to say,

[1700.42s - 1701.98s] I've got to pick one thing
[1701.98s - 1703.78s] that I've got to do for the rest of my life.
[1703.78s - 1705.14s] That's how you were trained.
[1705.14s - 1707.78s] So when you were young, you start narrowing down your subjects,
[1707.78s - 1709.54s] you get to college, you pick a major,
[1709.54s - 1710.74s] you focus in on one thing
[1710.74s - 1712.66s] and you think you have to do that for the rest of your life.
[1712.66s - 1714.42s] And then you start doing it for three years
[1714.42s - 1716.98s] and then three years into a new job, you go,
[1717.02s - 1718.54s] I don't want to do this anymore.
[1718.54s - 1719.98s] This isn't what it was meant to be.
[1719.98s - 1722.94s] But your whole life, you were told you could only be one thing.
[1722.94s - 1725.02s] You had to pick one thing to focus on.
[1725.02s - 1727.18s] So that's why we're so obsessed with this idea
[1727.18s - 1730.10s] that my title should have to be one thing.

[1730.10s - 1731.82s] I should be able to say, I'm a lawyer, I'm an accountant,
[1731.82s - 1734.46s] I'm a doctor, I'm a nurse, I'm a teacher, I'm a mom,
[1734.46s - 1737.06s] whatever it is, but I can't be three things.
[1737.06s - 1738.18s] That's complicated.
[1738.18s - 1741.26s] But we've been forced to believe that you are that title.
[1741.26s - 1743.14s] You are a manager, or by the way,
[1743.14s - 1745.54s] senior manager and you feel better about it,
[1745.54s - 1748.06s] or executive and you made to feel better about it,
[1748.06s - 1749.54s] but you're only allowed to be that.
[1749.54s - 1751.10s] You can't then be anything else.
[1751.10s - 1753.70s] And so I love it when I see people in their Instagram bios
[1753.70s - 1755.58s] and people are like, I'm a mom first,
[1755.58s - 1756.78s] but I'm an executive second.
[1756.78s - 1759.50s] I'm a this, I love it that people are playing with that idea
[1759.50s - 1761.54s] because that's the permission we need.

[1762.50s - 1767.50s] So Jay, what is the difference between purpose and passion?
[1767.90s - 1770.54s] And what do we get wrong about it?
[1770.54s - 1772.94s] Passion is what brings you life.
[1772.94s - 1774.38s] It's what brings you joy.
[1774.38s - 1778.90s] It's what makes you feel like you're doing something exciting
[1778.90s - 1780.46s] and exhilarating and thrilling.
[1780.46s - 1783.66s] So for me, it's studying and learning and synthesizing.
[1783.66s - 1786.90s] I could spend a weekend in a cave of books
[1786.90s - 1789.22s] and never get out and make notes and study.
[1789.22s - 1792.20s] That's one of my greatest passions in life.
[1792.20s - 1795.40s] Your purpose is when you use your passion
[1795.40s - 1797.28s] in the service of others.
[1797.28s - 1800.64s] If your passion doesn't have a service element,
[1800.64s - 1803.28s] if you don't use it to improve people's lives,
[1803.28s - 1805.52s] if you don't use it to inform other people,

[1805.52s - 1808.40s] if you don't use it to make a difference in someone's life,
[1808.40s - 1809.92s] it's not a purpose.
[1809.92s - 1811.32s] So let me give an example.
[1811.32s - 1813.16s] If you're a photographer
[1813.16s - 1815.64s] and your favorite passion in the world is photography,
[1815.64s - 1817.76s] you love finding unique locations,
[1817.76s - 1819.80s] you love capturing human emotion,
[1819.80s - 1822.28s] you love capturing memories for people.
[1822.28s - 1825.16s] As soon as you start doing it for others, it's a purpose.
[1825.16s - 1826.00s] There you have it.
[1826.00s - 1826.84s] It's that simple.
[1826.84s - 1829.48s] It's not like you have to go on a whole charity trail
[1829.48s - 1831.72s] and start taking pictures and giving them out for free.
[1831.72s - 1833.12s] When you start capturing moments
[1833.12s - 1836.08s] and you do it with that intent, it's a service.
[1836.08s - 1837.72s] There's a beautiful study that I love

[1837.72s - 1839.96s] from Amy Vrasniewski and her team
[1839.96s - 1841.92s] at the Yale School of Management.
[1841.92s - 1845.96s] So they went out in 2019 to research
[1845.96s - 1849.96s] what they believed was the most difficult job in America.
[1849.96s - 1851.00s] Any guesses, Mel?
[1853.34s - 1855.54s] Psychologically or physically?
[1855.54s - 1857.58s] Well, they just went out to think
[1857.58s - 1858.42s] what was the most difficult job.
[1858.42s - 1859.66s] Well, I think probably a teacher.
[1859.66s - 1861.18s] Yeah, that was up there.
[1861.18s - 1862.54s] Or public servant, I don't know.
[1862.54s - 1864.82s] All up there, the one that they decided on
[1864.82s - 1866.74s] was hospital cleaner.
[1866.74s - 1868.18s] Because they believe that these people
[1868.18s - 1871.66s] not only have to wash bed sheets, pillows, floors,
[1871.66s - 1874.22s] toilets, plates, they have to wash up
[1874.22s - 1875.78s] after people pass away.

[1875.78s - 1876.86s] So it's a very heavy job.
[1876.86s - 1879.14s] And also, you just finished cleaning a toilet,
[1879.14s - 1881.54s] you leave and now you've got to run in and clean it again.
[1881.54s - 1883.90s] It's not as simple as, hey, we did that once
[1883.90s - 1885.34s] and it doesn't happen anymore.
[1885.34s - 1887.98s] So they went and interviewed these hospital cleaners
[1887.98s - 1889.66s] and they asked them what they did.
[1889.66s - 1891.54s] And the hospital cleaners said,
[1891.54s - 1894.62s] we believe we're low skilled labor in their own words.
[1894.62s - 1896.78s] We wash toilets, plates, floors.
[1896.78s - 1899.50s] They carried on and they found this whole group
[1899.50s - 1903.14s] of hospital cleaners who didn't call themselves cleaners.
[1903.14s - 1907.06s] They called themselves healers and carers.
[1907.06s - 1911.78s] These healers worked the exact same hours as the cleaners.
[1911.78s - 1914.18s] They worked the same shifts.

[1914.18s - 1915.94s] They worked the same hospitals.
[1915.94s - 1917.58s] They got paid the same amount,
[1917.58s - 1920.94s] but they were happier, more purposeful and more productive.
[1920.94s - 1923.94s] So they asked them, why do you call yourself healers?
[1923.94s - 1927.46s] They said, and this blew my mind, like every time I think
[1927.46s - 1929.78s] about this, it really makes me emotional
[1929.78s - 1931.18s] because it's so powerful.
[1931.18s - 1936.28s] They said, we believe that a clean hospital is integral
[1937.40s - 1939.76s] to the healing journey of a patient.
[1939.76s - 1942.48s] We think that when the hospital is clean,
[1942.48s - 1946.56s] people have more dignity at a time of difficulty.
[1946.56s - 1949.62s] We believe that when the hospital is clean,
[1949.66s - 1953.46s] that people's families will spend more time with them,
[1953.46s - 1955.70s] they'll actually surround their bedside
[1955.70s - 1957.78s] because it feels like a clean atmosphere

[1957.78s - 1959.91s] in their time of need.
[1959.91s - 1964.67s] They said, we believe that a clean hospital is part of healing.
[1964.67s - 1967.93s] So how could we see ourselves as anything else?
[1967.93s - 1970.77s] What I love about that now is that Amy
[1970.77s - 1974.37s] of his new scanner team came up with a term called job crafting,
[1974.37s - 1978.74s] which means it's not what you do every day.
[1978.74s - 1981.58s] It's how you feel about what you do every day.
[1981.58s - 1983.54s] That changes the experience of it.
[1983.54s - 1984.74s] It's not just what you do.
[1984.74s - 1986.10s] It's not even why you do it.
[1986.10s - 1988.14s] It's how you feel about it.
[1988.14s - 1990.26s] How do you feel about what you do?
[1990.26s - 1993.94s] They all felt that what they did was critical to healing
[1993.94s - 1996.06s] and it transformed their experience.
[1996.06s - 1997.98s] And there's this beautiful quote from Wayne Dyer

[1997.98s - 2000.10s] that I loved where he said,
[2000.10s - 2002.74s] when you change the way you look at things,
[2002.74s - 2005.30s] the things you look at change.
[2005.30s - 2007.98s] And I really believe that that's what we're all being called
[2007.98s - 2009.02s] to do right now.
[2009.02s - 2010.58s] When you're feeling stuck,
[2010.58s - 2012.98s] you might not be able to change what's around you.
[2012.98s - 2016.22s] So change how you view it, change how you look at it.
[2016.22s - 2017.22s] Because all of a sudden,
[2017.22s - 2020.02s] everything starts to change in your favor.
[2020.02s - 2022.34s] That is the single best definition
[2022.34s - 2024.11s] of purpose I've ever heard.
[2024.11s - 2026.11s] And it's accessible.
[2026.11s - 2028.79s] And I wanna make sure that as you're listening to Jay
[2028.79s - 2030.51s] and you're spending time together with us
[2030.51s - 2033.71s] that you really take away that definition.

[2033.71s - 2035.51s] Because it's even when you're stuck
[2035.51s - 2038.47s] or even when you've just got a lot going on,
[2038.47s - 2042.39s] it's very easy to identify the little things in your life
[2042.39s - 2045.95s] that energize you, whether it's books like Jay or for me,
[2045.95s - 2049.31s] it's I love gardening and flowers and I love cooking.
[2049.31s - 2051.91s] I love spending time with my family.
[2051.91s - 2053.23s] I love making people smart.
[2053.23s - 2054.83s] That brings me energy, right?
[2054.83s - 2055.89s] I love being outside.
[2055.89s - 2057.23s] I love learning.
[2057.23s - 2060.27s] And so when you take those things
[2060.27s - 2062.11s] that naturally bring you energy
[2062.11s - 2064.79s] and you do a little bit more of it, it lifts you up.
[2064.79s - 2066.95s] But then when you figure out ways
[2066.95s - 2070.39s] to extend those things that bring you energy
[2070.39s - 2073.03s] in service of others,

[2073.03s - 2075.95s] now you're on the track of discovering
[2075.95s - 2078.19s] why you're here in the first place.
[2078.19s - 2079.87s] And aligning your life with purpose.
[2079.87s - 2083.38s] And so in that beautiful example you just gave
[2083.38s - 2087.66s] and thinking about it energizes people to be
[2087.66s - 2090.86s] like part of something where you're caring for people.
[2090.86s - 2092.26s] Even in the hardest job in the world,
[2092.26s - 2093.94s] that's why I use that example.
[2093.94s - 2096.42s] Because those individuals may not even be passionate
[2096.42s - 2099.46s] about cleaning, but they've found a way
[2099.46s - 2100.62s] to think about it differently.
[2100.62s - 2102.42s] That's why it touches my heart so much
[2102.42s - 2105.58s] because it's in such a difficult space and environment.
[2105.58s - 2107.38s] And to your point, Mel, what you were just saying,
[2107.38s - 2111.38s] I was talking to one of my team about this

[2111.38s - 2114.30s] and she was talking to me about how her mom
[2114.30s - 2116.58s] didn't really know what her purpose was.
[2116.58s - 2118.26s] So I asked her, what's her passion?
[2118.26s - 2120.10s] And she said her favorite thing
[2120.10s - 2122.82s] is to organize family trips.
[2122.82s - 2126.74s] And so now her mom has started organizing family trips
[2126.74s - 2129.98s] for not only her family, but the friends of her family
[2129.98s - 2130.82s] and couples.
[2130.82s - 2134.22s] And so she's a retired mom at this point in her life,
[2134.22s - 2135.86s] but she loves planning trips.
[2135.86s - 2138.58s] She lives vicariously through all of her kids
[2138.58s - 2141.06s] and their friends and grandkids and whoever else it is.
[2141.06s - 2142.34s] And that's what she does now.
[2142.34s - 2143.62s] That's a purpose.
[2143.62s - 2145.90s] Your purpose doesn't need to be this big thing
[2145.90s - 2148.50s] that you have to go and change a million people's lives

[2148.50s - 2149.42s] or a billion people's lives.
[2149.42s - 2151.18s] If you can do that, that's beautiful.
[2151.18s - 2152.38s] But that's not what a purpose is.
[2152.38s - 2155.26s] Your purpose is not defined by scale.
[2155.26s - 2158.22s] It's not defined by the amount of people you reach.
[2158.22s - 2160.34s] It's not defined by doing something big.
[2160.34s - 2162.46s] Your purpose doesn't have to be your job.
[2162.46s - 2165.30s] It doesn't have to be something you dream of doing every day.
[2165.30s - 2167.86s] Your purpose is simply using your passion
[2167.86s - 2170.50s] in the service of others in the smallest of ways,
[2170.50s - 2172.02s] in the simplest of ways.
[2172.02s - 2173.70s] And it brings you so much joy.
[2173.70s - 2177.46s] And by the way, it also gives you validation
[2177.46s - 2179.10s] for something beautiful that you do.
[2179.10s - 2180.34s] We all want validation.
[2180.34s - 2181.54s] We all seek it.

[2181.54s - 2182.98s] And I want to just normalize that
[2182.98s - 2185.74s] because I think people feel bad for wanting it.
[2185.74s - 2187.98s] But we all need to feel wanted and needed
[2187.98s - 2190.58s] and loved it's part of being human.
[2190.58s - 2194.46s] But the problem is when you become someone you don't want to be
[2194.46s - 2197.34s] or do something you don't want to do to get validation.
[2197.34s - 2199.50s] Whereas when you get validated for using your passion
[2199.50s - 2201.14s] in the service of others,
[2201.14s - 2203.34s] there's no greater feeling than that.
[2203.34s - 2204.54s] You know, I want to give an example
[2204.54s - 2206.94s] because I feel like one of the mistakes
[2206.94s - 2208.42s] that I made for a long time
[2208.42s - 2211.30s] when it came to, quote, discovering my purpose
[2211.30s - 2213.62s] is that I thought it was one thing.
[2213.62s - 2217.10s] And it's actually everything.
[2217.10s - 2217.94s] Yes.

[2217.94s - 2219.70s] And so when we moved to Southern Vermont
[2219.70s - 2222.86s] and I remember feeling very stuck and in a new chapter
[2222.86s - 2226.66s] and isolated and needing to like meet all new friends
[2226.66s - 2228.10s] and build community,
[2228.10s - 2232.18s] that I learned of this flower farmer
[2232.18s - 2236.74s] and her flowers were, it was near the end of the summer
[2236.74s - 2239.26s] and into fall and Frost was coming and it's dahlias.
[2239.26s - 2240.86s] And you need to dig them up.
[2240.86s - 2243.30s] I know I'm getting really geeky on the flowers.
[2243.30s - 2245.38s] And the frost was starting to hit
[2245.38s - 2248.38s] and it was an entire field and they were all going to die.
[2248.38s - 2252.74s] And I felt this like ache because flowers bring me energy.
[2254.30s - 2256.74s] I tracked down the person
[2256.74s - 2259.62s] who was growing the flowers and found out
[2259.62s - 2262.02s] that they had had a health issue.

[2262.02s - 2266.06s] And so I organized a bunch of women that I had recently met
[2266.06s - 2270.18s] to help this person dig up the tubers.
[2270.18s - 2274.26s] That is an example that has nothing to do with career.
[2274.26s - 2277.46s] It has nothing to do with my life's mission
[2277.46s - 2279.62s] and all the things I do for work.
[2279.62s - 2284.14s] It is a small example of how I took something
[2284.14s - 2288.98s] that energized me and use that energy
[2288.98s - 2293.38s] that's authentic to me in service of someone else.
[2293.38s - 2298.54s] And that small example is an example
[2298.54s - 2301.14s] of how you can infuse a sense of purpose
[2301.14s - 2304.66s] in your day to day life in really small
[2304.66s - 2306.90s] but deeply meaningful important ways.
[2306.90s - 2308.74s] Yes, yes, I love that.
[2308.74s - 2310.10s] And it's so true.
[2310.10s - 2311.98s] I'm thinking about Radi when Radi first moved

[2311.98s - 2314.26s] with me to America, she couldn't work here
[2314.26s - 2315.58s] because she was on a spouse visa
[2315.58s - 2317.90s] and until we all got all that sorted out.
[2317.90s - 2322.02s] And Radi wasn't always the writer of a New York Times
[2322.02s - 2322.86s] best-selling cookbook.
[2322.86s - 2326.78s] Like that's a very like recent iteration of her life.
[2326.78s - 2328.34s] Well, when we became friends, Jay,
[2328.34s - 2332.34s] so you know, like you and I have been friends for a long time
[2332.34s - 2336.30s] and we are extremely supportive and fond of one another,
[2336.30s - 2338.02s] our spouses know each other.
[2338.02s - 2339.70s] But when I first met you and Radi,
[2339.70s - 2343.02s] she had not launched this part of her life.
[2343.02s - 2345.54s] Absolutely, no social media, no content.
[2345.54s - 2346.62s] Yeah, exactly.
[2346.62s - 2348.78s] And so obviously we remember her like that.
[2348.78s - 2350.22s] She isn't like that to the world now

[2350.22s - 2353.74s] but I remember when we moved to LA,
[2353.74s - 2355.74s] Radi would just be really sad
[2355.74s - 2358.94s] when we'd be driving around and see the homeless situation.
[2358.94s - 2360.98s] And she always loved cooking.
[2360.98s - 2362.26s] Like she was always a fan of cooking
[2362.26s - 2364.62s] since I've known her, she's been an amazing cook.
[2364.62s - 2366.54s] She would literally just cook and deliver meals.
[2366.54s - 2368.42s] She'd get involved in food distribution programs
[2368.42s - 2369.34s] in the area.
[2369.34s - 2371.06s] She'd go and find out and talk to communities
[2371.06s - 2372.54s] of how she could help.
[2372.54s - 2374.26s] Before she made any content,
[2374.26s - 2376.26s] she was just out there doing that.
[2376.26s - 2378.62s] And that's what built her confidence
[2378.62s - 2380.50s] in being able to do it and being able to deliver.
[2380.50s - 2382.06s] And then even when someone said to her,

[2382.06s - 2383.06s] hey, would you cater?
[2383.06s - 2385.50s] She said, I don't want to do it as catering.
[2385.50s - 2387.30s] She loves cooking as an act of love,
[2387.30s - 2388.70s] as an act of service.
[2388.70s - 2390.74s] If you come over, she'd want to cook for you
[2390.74s - 2392.82s] because you're a friend, that's what she enjoys.
[2392.82s - 2394.30s] She wants to cook for people in need,
[2394.30s - 2396.62s] that's what she gets passion from.
[2396.62s - 2397.78s] She doesn't actually want to be said,
[2397.78s - 2399.70s] hey, can you make 20 meals of this?
[2399.70s - 2402.18s] That's not actually what brings her joy.
[2402.18s - 2404.94s] And so you can see how your purpose
[2404.94s - 2406.58s] doesn't have to be your job.
[2406.58s - 2408.58s] Your purpose doesn't have to be big.
[2408.58s - 2410.90s] Your purpose doesn't have to get you followers.
[2410.90s - 2413.38s] Your purpose doesn't need to have social media.

[2413.38s - 2415.18s] It doesn't need to have any of those things.
[2415.18s - 2417.94s] And actually, if you start without all of those things,
[2417.94s - 2422.38s] you'll build more confidence, more self-worth and more joy,
[2422.38s - 2424.26s] that then if you want to do any of those things,
[2424.26s - 2425.62s] they'll happen naturally.
[2425.62s - 2427.38s] They'll come as a byproduct
[2427.38s - 2429.78s] of that infectious energy you feel
[2429.78s - 2431.02s] and that I've seen rather you feel.
[2431.02s - 2434.34s] Well, I want to come back to two themes and highlight it.
[2434.34s - 2435.42s] You know, one of the things that you said
[2435.42s - 2439.14s] is it's not about imagining the thing out there.
[2439.14s - 2442.26s] It's about really stopping and listening
[2442.26s - 2445.82s] and reflecting on what Jay is sharing with you
[2445.82s - 2447.86s] about the fact that there's something
[2447.86s - 2450.14s] that's already bringing you energy,

[2450.14s - 2454.82s] that when you do it, it just brings something out in you
[2454.82s - 2457.50s] and then finding ways to do it in service of others.
[2457.50s - 2460.14s] So if you take the example of your wife,
[2460.14s - 2463.86s] she's focused on cooking as an act of love.
[2463.86s - 2465.54s] It's always been a creative expression.
[2465.54s - 2468.02s] It naturally energizes her.
[2468.02s - 2471.22s] And so she used that to lift herself up
[2471.22s - 2472.42s] in a new chapter of her life.
[2472.42s - 2475.74s] She found a way to be of service.
[2475.74s - 2479.53s] And the amazing thing about life
[2479.53s - 2481.37s] is that when you align yourself
[2481.37s - 2483.93s] with the things that naturally energize you
[2483.93s - 2486.37s] and you, let's come to a second thing we've talked about,
[2486.37s - 2489.77s] Jay, trust that where you are
[2489.77s - 2495.53s] is somehow in service of where you're meant to go.

[2495.53s - 2499.89s] Follow the energy and follow how you serve others
[2499.89s - 2501.85s] in sharing that energy
[2501.85s - 2506.73s] and that is how you actually start walking in the path
[2506.73s - 2507.85s] that is meant for you.
[2507.85s - 2510.14s] And I just want to point out
[2510.14s - 2512.70s] that not only is she in New York Times
[2512.70s - 2514.86s] best-selling cookbook author,
[2514.86s - 2519.86s] but the name of the cookbook is Joy Full as an F-U-L-L
[2522.10s - 2525.14s] because you're full of her fabulous vegan cooking.
[2525.14s - 2528.94s] And so she didn't start cooking
[2528.94s - 2530.98s] and serving people in L.A.
[2531.02s - 2533.50s] because she's like, I'm gonna write a cookbook one of these days.
[2533.50s - 2537.22s] Exactly. She did it to lift herself up
[2537.22s - 2540.62s] at a moment in her life where she was stuck
[2540.62s - 2542.62s] and where she was moving to a new place.
[2542.62s - 2545.70s] And so it's so important to understand

[2545.70s - 2548.18s] it's not the thing that you're imagining.
[2548.18s - 2549.70s] It's the energy in you
[2549.70s - 2552.22s] and it's the ability to shift your mindset
[2552.22s - 2554.86s] and trust that if you leverage that positive energy
[2554.86s - 2556.18s] in service of others,
[2556.18s - 2560.94s] it always, always, always points you where you're meant to go.
[2560.94s - 2563.62s] Yes. And people will say to us,
[2563.62s - 2565.62s] but I don't know what I like.
[2565.62s - 2566.98s] I don't know what gives me energy.
[2566.98s - 2568.22s] I hear that a lot today.
[2568.22s - 2569.06s] You do.
[2569.06s - 2570.58s] Yeah, but it's like people are just like,
[2570.58s - 2572.86s] I don't know what gives me energy anymore.
[2572.86s - 2573.74s] I'm kind of numb to it.
[2573.74s - 2576.42s] Like, and I think the point is not to find this
[2576.42s - 2579.38s] big, bright light of energy from something.
[2579.38s - 2581.50s] It's this small, tiny voice.

[2581.50s - 2583.86s] It's been ignored for so long
[2583.86s - 2586.02s] that the way it shows up within us
[2586.02s - 2589.14s] isn't always this big, loud scream.
[2589.14s - 2591.70s] It's this quiet little whisper that just says,
[2591.70s - 2593.58s] try this, give it a go.
[2593.58s - 2594.98s] It's not this big calling.
[2594.98s - 2596.98s] I think we think about callings
[2596.98s - 2599.50s] and what we want to do is this big,
[2599.50s - 2602.14s] bright light of information and a sign.
[2602.14s - 2604.10s] Signs are small.
[2604.10s - 2606.62s] They're whispers, they're quiet.
[2606.62s - 2608.74s] And I think if we just lean into that,
[2608.74s - 2611.06s] it may just be the little voice in your head that says,
[2611.06s - 2613.54s] you love organizing birthdays.
[2613.54s - 2614.38s] Why don't you just organize
[2614.38s - 2616.91s] a couple more birthday parties this year?
[2616.91s - 2618.75s] Oh, you're really good at event planning.

[2618.75s - 2620.95s] Why don't you help your friend with that wedding?
[2620.95s - 2623.59s] You know what, you're really, really good at writing.
[2623.59s - 2626.19s] Why don't you just write a quote every day?
[2626.19s - 2627.75s] Right, it's that little voice.
[2627.75s - 2629.59s] So just follow the whisper.
[2629.59s - 2631.59s] Do you think that your life, if you look backwards,
[2631.59s - 2634.35s] also provides answers for what energizes you?
[2634.35s - 2637.63s] Because I think it's a very important point to validate
[2637.63s - 2640.11s] that we are at a moment in time
[2640.11s - 2644.03s] where the research bears out that over 80% of us
[2644.03s - 2646.87s] are living in a state of chronic stress.
[2646.87s - 2647.79s] Yes.
[2647.83s - 2652.83s] The feeling of being numb is very, very common right now
[2653.23s - 2655.99s] and probably a sign that you're actually mentally well
[2655.99s - 2658.47s] because there's so much chaos and overwhelm and stuff.

[2658.47s - 2661.59s] But so validating that,
[2661.59s - 2665.19s] and even if somebody turns inward and doesn't quite feel it,
[2665.19s - 2668.31s] are there other things that someone can do
[2668.31s - 2671.07s] that you would recommend to help access that
[2671.07s - 2672.39s] if you're just at a point where you just,
[2672.39s - 2675.27s] I am so spent, I don't even know myself anymore.
[2675.27s - 2677.47s] I promise you, and I really mean this,
[2677.47s - 2680.83s] and I want everyone to really internalize this as I say it,
[2680.83s - 2684.27s] you are already successful at something.
[2684.27s - 2688.51s] It's just so easy to you that you don't think of as success.
[2688.51s - 2691.07s] There's something that comes effortlessly to you.
[2691.07s - 2693.63s] Maybe you graduate at college with flying colors.
[2693.63s - 2697.31s] Maybe you take care of your kids in the best way possible.
[2697.31s - 2700.03s] Maybe you're just incredible as showing up

[2700.03s - 2701.47s] for your work colleagues.
[2701.47s - 2704.75s] You already are extremely incredibly successful
[2704.75s - 2707.39s] at something, but because it's easy for you
[2707.39s - 2710.43s] and natural for you, you don't think it's a skill.
[2710.43s - 2712.39s] So look back at your life,
[2712.39s - 2716.11s] and look back at all the things that you've done beautifully.
[2716.11s - 2718.07s] You showed up for your friends at college.
[2718.07s - 2720.15s] You helped your colleagues through a tough time.
[2720.15s - 2721.95s] You've already been doing that.
[2721.95s - 2723.67s] You just don't know what that looks like
[2723.67s - 2725.95s] because you think that's what a good person does.
[2725.95s - 2727.55s] And it is what a good person does.
[2727.55s - 2729.39s] But on top of that, it is value
[2729.39s - 2731.59s] that you've been adding all along the way.
[2731.59s - 2733.99s] Look at the clues, look at the footprints,

[2733.99s - 2735.79s] look at the steps behind,
[2735.79s - 2737.35s] and don't take the for granted.
[2737.35s - 2740.39s] Most likely, the things that you don't value
[2740.39s - 2742.39s] because they're simple to you are the things
[2742.39s - 2744.03s] that the world is looking for.
[2744.03s - 2746.07s] Rather, this cooking skill is something
[2746.07s - 2747.39s] that comes really naturally to her.
[2747.39s - 2749.19s] She's worked on it, but it's natural.
[2749.19s - 2750.59s] She didn't value it.
[2750.59s - 2753.43s] She didn't realize what a superpower it was.
[2753.43s - 2755.91s] So Jay, for the person who's listening,
[2755.91s - 2759.08s] who's now scanning their life
[2759.08s - 2760.58s] and thinking about what they're good at
[2760.58s - 2765.92s] and they're coming up with nothing, what is your advice?
[2765.96s - 2769.04s] Here's my number one piece of advice.
[2769.04s - 2771.32s] Pick three people from your past.

[2771.32s - 2775.28s] Could be a work colleague, a family member, and a friend.
[2775.28s - 2777.48s] These are people that know you deeply,
[2777.48s - 2780.21s] that you would say know me really, really well.
[2780.21s - 2782.25s] Not don't go and do this with anyone else.
[2782.25s - 2784.78s] Do this with people that know you really well.
[2784.78s - 2789.16s] And just ask them, what's something that I do
[2789.16s - 2790.84s] that you always think of me
[2790.84s - 2793.10s] when you're struggling with something?
[2793.10s - 2796.06s] Ask them what's something that I've done in the past
[2796.06s - 2798.66s] for you or for anyone around us that made you go,
[2798.66s - 2801.58s] wow, that's really cool, that's amazing.
[2801.58s - 2803.70s] And then sit down and ask them,
[2803.70s - 2806.22s] when you're struggling with something,
[2806.22s - 2807.30s] what do I help you do?
[2807.30s - 2808.82s] What do I help you solve?

[2808.82s - 2811.30s] All of a sudden you get all this input
[2811.30s - 2813.10s] from the people that know you the best
[2813.10s - 2816.38s] because they see in you what you don't see in yourself.
[2816.38s - 2817.98s] We have to remember that.
[2817.98s - 2820.26s] The people that know you and the people that love you,
[2820.26s - 2823.70s] they see in you what you don't see in yourself.
[2823.70s - 2826.82s] What you undervalue is what they deeply value.
[2826.82s - 2830.10s] What you take for granted is what they see as greatness.
[2830.10s - 2832.58s] What you kind of think is normal and average,
[2832.58s - 2834.74s] they adore about you.
[2834.74s - 2836.30s] But you've got to let them tell you that.
[2836.30s - 2838.58s] You've got to let them remind you of that
[2838.58s - 2841.51s] because otherwise you'll keep devaluing yourself.
[2841.51s - 2844.15s] You know what's interesting is that I remember,

[2845.19s - 2847.59s] this was like two years before I started the podcast.
[2849.30s - 2851.02s] Would literally listen,
[2851.02s - 2853.02s] I still listen to your podcast, Jay,
[2853.02s - 2857.06s] and watch your videos and find so much inspiration from you.
[2857.06s - 2858.90s] I didn't realize I kind of did that with you
[2858.90s - 2860.90s] because I was very stuck.
[2860.90s - 2865.38s] I had reached a point where I was so tired of being on planes
[2865.38s - 2868.50s] and doing the motivational speaking at corporate events,
[2868.50s - 2870.06s] even though I loved it.
[2870.06s - 2874.30s] And I so wanted to get into the podcasting space.
[2874.30s - 2876.54s] And I always know when I want something
[2876.54s - 2881.06s] because unlike you who is a very like loving
[2881.06s - 2885.46s] and positive person, my signs show up as jealousy.
[2885.46s - 2887.34s] I don't have the monk version,
[2887.34s - 2890.06s] I have the Mel Robbins version of inspiration.

[2890.06s - 2893.14s] It's sort of like agitation, right?
[2893.14s - 2895.94s] And so you have this incredible podcast
[2895.94s - 2900.94s] and I literally felt so jealous and excited for you.
[2901.22s - 2906.22s] But jealous, cause I'm doing it, that means I can't do it.
[2906.54s - 2908.70s] And you know, it's already done
[2908.70s - 2910.34s] and since he's already doing it,
[2910.34s - 2912.62s] he's just such a great job with on purpose
[2912.62s - 2914.06s] and the most perfect name.
[2914.06s - 2915.42s] And you know, there's like,
[2915.42s - 2918.54s] you kind of see it in somebody else
[2918.54s - 2920.86s] and you literally said to me,
[2920.86s - 2923.34s] Mel, you know what you should be doing?
[2923.34s - 2925.66s] You were, what are you gonna watch a podcast?
[2925.66s - 2927.30s] Like you would destroy it.
[2927.30s - 2932.30s] And so you reflected to me the thing that you saw
[2932.90s - 2937.02s] as the next thing that made the most sense.

[2937.02s - 2939.02s] And so I love that advice
[2939.02s - 2941.97s] because the people who do know you well
[2941.97s - 2944.49s] can see the things that you don't see in yourself
[2944.49s - 2947.85s] or see the possibilities
[2947.85s - 2952.01s] that you are actively holding yourself back from.
[2952.01s - 2952.85s] Yeah.
[2952.85s - 2953.73s] You know, one of the things that you've said
[2953.73s - 2956.41s] that I also love is you said weak people focus
[2956.41s - 2960.21s] on others' weaknesses, strong people focus on their strengths.
[2960.21s - 2961.89s] Can you unpack that?
[2961.89s - 2964.61s] Yeah, it actually perfectly fits with what you just said.
[2964.61s - 2970.06s] So weak people notice other people's mistakes and laugh.
[2971.65s - 2976.97s] Strong people notice other people's mistakes and learn.
[2976.97s - 2981.01s] Weak people talk about other people's problems
[2981.01s - 2982.53s] to feel better.

[2982.53s - 2985.49s] Strong people talk about other people's problems
[2985.49s - 2987.41s] to become better.
[2987.41s - 2992.41s] Weak people gossip about others to build fake connections.
[2992.57s - 2997.82s] Strong people express vulnerability to build real ones.
[2998.10s - 3000.90s] And this one's the kicker that you were just talking about.
[3000.90s - 3004.42s] Weak people envy people ahead of them.
[3004.42s - 3008.38s] Strong people study people ahead of them.
[3008.38s - 3010.10s] And the interesting thing is
[3010.10s - 3013.14s] both people are looking at the same thing
[3013.14s - 3015.18s] but they're seeing different things
[3015.18s - 3018.42s] because no one is a weak or strong person.
[3018.42s - 3020.42s] It's just what you focus on.
[3020.42s - 3022.22s] And that's what I want people to realize.
[3022.22s - 3023.50s] There's a switch.
[3023.50s - 3026.66s] The switch for envy is study.

[3026.66s - 3029.30s] If you're jealous of someone, if you're envious of someone,
[3029.30s - 3030.14s] study them.
[3030.14s - 3032.06s] And I know we've had so many conversations
[3032.06s - 3034.14s] where we've both taught each other so much stuff.
[3034.14s - 3036.62s] You've always been so kind to share so many insights
[3036.62s - 3037.46s] and lessons.
[3037.46s - 3039.34s] I know I've done the same with you.
[3039.34s - 3040.18s] That's what we do.
[3040.18s - 3041.74s] We study each other.
[3041.74s - 3043.02s] And all of a sudden,
[3043.02s - 3047.30s] that envy turns into appreciation, admiration,
[3047.30s - 3050.18s] just complete all because you're like,
[3050.22s - 3052.30s] now I know what it takes, right?
[3052.30s - 3055.30s] I remember when I used to see Cristiano Ronaldo
[3055.30s - 3057.46s] who I'm a huge fan of.
[3057.46s - 3061.42s] And I've been a fan of him ever since he was 17 years old.

[3061.42s - 3063.70s] And so I must have been like 14 or something like that
[3063.70s - 3065.34s] when I started following him.
[3065.34s - 3066.58s] This is 20 years ago now,
[3066.58s - 3068.70s] you're talking about more than that.
[3068.70s - 3070.78s] And you look at him and you think,
[3070.78s - 3072.38s] oh my God, like look how he looks,
[3072.38s - 3074.70s] look how he plays, everything else.
[3074.70s - 3077.98s] The moment you start studying his routine,
[3077.98s - 3080.30s] you realize what it actually takes.
[3080.30s - 3083.02s] Someone can sit there and envy and be jealous of his life,
[3083.02s - 3083.86s] which is natural by the way.
[3083.86s - 3086.06s] And I don't want to make that seem like a bad thing.
[3086.06s - 3089.06s] But you turn jealousy into study.
[3089.06s - 3091.42s] You turn envy into study and all of a sudden,
[3091.42s - 3092.62s] it's your best friend.
[3092.62s - 3094.46s] Envy can be your best friend

[3094.46s - 3096.30s] if you just replace it for study.
[3096.30s - 3097.46s] 100%.
[3097.46s - 3098.30s] I love that.
[3098.30s - 3100.50s] And that's exactly what I did.
[3100.50s - 3102.14s] The thing that's interesting is that,
[3102.14s - 3104.30s] you know, with a reason why I wanted to highlight
[3104.30s - 3107.22s] that jealousy can be a useful tool.
[3107.22s - 3109.50s] Jealousy for me is very different than envy
[3109.50s - 3110.82s] because when I would look at you,
[3110.82s - 3115.54s] I would never envy you like you don't deserve that.
[3115.54s - 3119.58s] Jealousy for me is this deep stirring
[3119.58s - 3122.54s] because it's impossible to be jealous
[3122.54s - 3124.14s] of something that's not meant for you.
[3124.14s - 3124.98s] Yes.
[3124.98s - 3127.14s] And so I've never been jealous of anybody
[3127.14s - 3128.66s] who drives a Lamborghini.
[3128.66s - 3130.38s] I've never been jealous of anybody
[3130.38s - 3132.30s] that lives in a penthouse apartment.

[3132.30s - 3133.42s] I've never, you know what I'm saying?
[3133.42s - 3135.94s] Like I don't want those things.
[3135.94s - 3137.62s] But there was something about the way
[3137.62s - 3140.90s] that you took something that energizes you learning,
[3140.90s - 3143.46s] connection, purpose,
[3143.46s - 3148.10s] and you created a business that was in service to others
[3148.10s - 3149.86s] around the things that energize you.
[3149.86s - 3152.98s] And that's what was, I think, ultimately the thing
[3152.98s - 3154.82s] that was stirring something in me.
[3154.82s - 3157.34s] And that's a super, super useful tool.
[3157.34s - 3159.38s] But the other thing I wanted to validate
[3159.38s - 3161.62s] is that the second I said,
[3161.62s - 3162.82s] I'm gonna walk toward this thing.
[3162.82s - 3164.46s] I'm gonna figure this out.
[3164.46s - 3168.86s] I spent two years studying you, talking to you,
[3168.86s - 3172.02s] and that piece of allowing yourself,

[3172.02s - 3175.10s] and it goes back to what you said about the experiment.
[3175.10s - 3178.18s] Learn, reflect, and part of reflecting
[3178.18s - 3180.10s] is experiment with something.
[3181.37s - 3182.85s] I was a student for two years.
[3182.85s - 3185.45s] There's a reason why we came out of the gate
[3185.45s - 3188.29s] and launched two episodes a week.
[3188.29s - 3190.17s] It's because I learned from you
[3190.17s - 3194.57s] that if you do want to have a successful show,
[3194.57s - 3196.93s] you have to do at least that many episodes.
[3196.93s - 3201.61s] And so the learning part and the studying others
[3201.61s - 3204.85s] and allowing others to lead the way and to show you
[3204.85s - 3209.85s] and to truly flip envy into learning from somebody.
[3211.05s - 3216.18s] That is worth $100 million in your life to understand
[3216.98s - 3220.14s] that everybody that is out in the world right now
[3220.14s - 3222.82s] is somebody that you can learn from.

[3222.82s - 3224.34s] It's just unbelievable.
[3224.34s - 3227.58s] And so thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing that.
[3227.58s - 3228.98s] And there's another quote that you have
[3228.98s - 3231.10s] that I absolutely love, Jay.
[3231.10s - 3233.46s] We judge others by their actions,
[3233.46s - 3236.22s] but ourselves, by our intentions.
[3236.22s - 3237.26s] What does that mean?
[3237.26s - 3239.74s] This is something that actually my monk teachers
[3239.74s - 3241.82s] used to repeat to us a lot.
[3241.82s - 3245.26s] And it's a reality check that's a bit of a punch in the gut.
[3246.44s - 3249.92s] So we judge ourselves by our intentions,
[3249.92s - 3253.06s] and we judge other people by their actions.
[3253.06s - 3255.86s] So if we feel our intention was good,
[3255.86s - 3257.90s] we feel we're good people.
[3257.90s - 3262.38s] But if someone has a bad action, we feel they're bad people.
[3262.38s - 3266.06s] Whereas what we should be doing is allowing other people

[3266.06s - 3270.30s] to be judged also for their intentions and their actions.
[3270.30s - 3275.46s] So it's a plea, a proposal, a pledge to say
[3275.46s - 3280.06s] before you judge someone, before you put someone in a box,
[3280.06s - 3283.10s] please learn what their intention was.
[3283.10s - 3285.54s] Because often you'll find that their intention
[3285.54s - 3288.06s] probably wasn't as malicious as you think.
[3288.06s - 3290.22s] It wasn't as manipulative as you think.
[3290.22s - 3293.34s] It wasn't as crazy as you think.
[3293.34s - 3294.78s] It was the same as yours.
[3294.78s - 3296.70s] They too had good intentions.
[3296.70s - 3299.50s] They also got into it with good intentions.
[3299.50s - 3301.34s] But we judge ourselves by our intentions
[3301.34s - 3302.94s] so we think we're good people,
[3302.94s - 3304.54s] and we judge other people by their actions.
[3304.54s - 3306.10s] And so we think they're bad people.

[3306.10s - 3311.07s] If I made a mistake and you judge me for my action,
[3311.07s - 3312.87s] all of a sudden you've labeled me,
[3312.87s - 3315.87s] but my intention was so pure and so genuine.
[3315.87s - 3319.63s] I'll give you an example of something that happened recently
[3319.63s - 3323.39s] to me that I feel really, really applies to this.
[3323.39s - 3328.50s] And I was doing something with a friend.
[3328.50s - 3332.74s] And we did a podcast together
[3332.74s - 3337.22s] and I was traveling on the road or whatever
[3337.22s - 3340.70s] and I didn't post something about it.
[3340.70s - 3343.18s] And my friend messaged me
[3343.18s - 3345.22s] and was just feeling really upset
[3345.22s - 3347.02s] that I hadn't supported them,
[3347.02s - 3349.46s] that I hadn't noticed them, that I hadn't recognized them.
[3349.46s - 3350.62s] And now we're really good friends
[3350.62s - 3353.06s] so they were able to vocalize it to me.

[3353.06s - 3355.22s] But if we weren't, they would have immediately judged
[3355.22s - 3357.66s] and thought that I had some ulterior motive
[3357.66s - 3358.74s] or some agenda.
[3358.74s - 3360.26s] And the truth is I'm so disconnected
[3360.26s - 3362.38s] from my social media in the sense that I don't post.
[3362.38s - 3364.22s] I'm not there, I'm on the road,
[3364.22s - 3366.86s] I try and stay off my phone for most of the day.
[3366.86s - 3368.22s] And all of a sudden I was thinking,
[3368.22s - 3371.98s] wait a minute, if they judge me for my action,
[3371.98s - 3373.78s] it looks like I don't care about them,
[3373.78s - 3375.42s] it looks like I don't value them,
[3375.42s - 3377.58s] it looks like this is an important to me.
[3377.58s - 3379.58s] But my intention was, I love you,
[3379.58s - 3380.66s] you're one of my favorite people,
[3380.66s - 3382.70s] I'm here to help you in whatever way possible.

[3382.70s - 3386.02s] And I just think about the amount of friendships we'd save,
[3386.02s - 3388.66s] the amount of relationships we'd save
[3388.66s - 3392.94s] if we just learned to judge people for their intentions,
[3392.94s - 3394.26s] not their actions.
[3394.26s - 3395.78s] Do you have like a little trick?
[3395.78s - 3399.94s] Because my like emotions and pettiness
[3399.94s - 3401.86s] can just flood me.
[3401.86s - 3404.22s] Like I've never had training as a monk chase,
[3404.22s - 3406.62s] I would imagine like your sort of engine
[3406.62s - 3410.06s] doesn't rev as high as mine, but it is so easy
[3410.06s - 3413.06s] to see friends out together.
[3413.06s - 3416.86s] And then immediately judge them for their actions
[3416.86s - 3417.98s] that they're excluding you,
[3417.98s - 3419.54s] that they must be talking about you,
[3419.54s - 3422.50s] that now they're closer than you are to them,
[3422.50s - 3425.22s] that it means something, it means you did something.

[3425.22s - 3427.86s] And then of course you respond to all of that emotion,
[3427.86s - 3430.74s] we are so fast to assume,
[3430.74s - 3432.86s] is there anything that you do
[3432.86s - 3435.78s] or that you recommend that people do?
[3435.78s - 3436.66s] Well, there's this thing,
[3436.66s - 3437.70s] I don't know if you've heard of it,
[3437.70s - 3439.42s] it's called the Let them Theory.
[3439.42s - 3441.10s] Oh, shit.
[3441.10s - 3444.30s] Sorry, I had to, I had to, I was waiting for you.
[3444.30s - 3446.10s] Which is really good, there's let them
[3446.10s - 3446.94s] and then let me in it.
[3446.94s - 3447.86s] And it works perfectly,
[3447.86s - 3449.98s] which I genuinely believe it's amazing.
[3449.98s - 3452.66s] But to answer that your question,
[3452.66s - 3453.50s] I'll be honest with you,
[3453.50s - 3456.69s] when it's people that I know, I tell them,
[3457.89s - 3460.53s] I really believe it's important to tell people,

[3460.53s - 3462.77s] I check in with them, I ask them,
[3462.77s - 3466.29s] because if I know you, our relationship,
[3466.29s - 3470.35s] if our relationship means I can't ask you the question,
[3470.35s - 3472.69s] then it's a weak relationship.
[3472.69s - 3473.81s] If I ask you the question
[3473.81s - 3475.09s] and we have a great conversation,
[3475.09s - 3477.41s] now our relationship is strengthened by it,
[3477.41s - 3479.17s] we actually got closer,
[3479.17s - 3484.09s] our hard conversation should make you closer to the person,
[3484.09s - 3487.29s] our hard conversation should not make you further away from them.
[3487.29s - 3489.96s] Say that again, Jay.
[3489.96s - 3493.44s] If you love someone and they say they love you,
[3493.44s - 3497.64s] a hard conversation should bring you closer together,
[3497.64s - 3501.12s] a hard conversation should not push you away from each other.
[3501.12s - 3503.80s] If you're scared to have a hard conversation

[3503.80s - 3507.12s] with someone you love, that means you're not that close.
[3507.12s - 3508.12s] Dude, I think that's,
[3508.12s - 3509.68s] those are the hardest people to talk to though.
[3509.68s - 3512.20s] Yeah, but that should be the easiest person to talk to
[3512.20s - 3514.92s] because you should be able to have a safe space to raise it.
[3514.92s - 3516.72s] And so if I'm close to someone,
[3516.72s - 3518.84s] if it was me and you, I would call you up.
[3518.84s - 3522.24s] And I actually trust we'd have a great conversation because of it.
[3522.24s - 3523.56s] I know that, I actually believe that
[3523.56s - 3525.84s] if we ever had anything like that, which we haven't,
[3525.84s - 3527.04s] and I would call you.
[3527.04s - 3530.79s] But what I find is, if you can't call the person,
[3530.79s - 3532.39s] I would just think about,
[3532.39s - 3533.91s] this is the second part of that statement.
[3533.91s - 3535.83s] My monk teachers would always say,

[3535.83s - 3540.86s] instead of judging people by their actions,
[3541.26s - 3543.42s] judge them by their intentions
[3543.42s - 3547.78s] and judge yourself by your actions, not your intentions.
[3547.78s - 3551.14s] Oh, think about all the stupid things you've said,
[3551.14s - 3553.46s] you've done and got wrong.
[3553.46s - 3556.46s] And all of a sudden you start to recognize,
[3556.46s - 3559.26s] wait a minute, if someone judged me for that,
[3559.26s - 3560.78s] I'd feel pretty bad about it.
[3560.78s - 3562.94s] That doesn't define me, that's not who I am.
[3562.94s - 3565.30s] And all of a sudden when you have that reflection,
[3565.30s - 3567.34s] it flips the entire statement.
[3567.34s - 3569.62s] Wait a minute, that can't be who I am
[3569.62s - 3571.66s] and that's not who they are.
[3571.66s - 3572.74s] Amazing.
[3572.74s - 3574.58s] Here's another thing that you said recently, Jay,
[3574.58s - 3575.42s] that I love.

[3575.42s - 3580.54s] Someone out there would love to live your worst day.
[3580.54s - 3584.62s] What does that mean?
[3584.62s - 3588.29s] We're really quick to forget
[3588.29s - 3590.53s] that the day we're living today
[3590.53s - 3593.58s] is a day we dreamed of 10 years ago.
[3593.58s - 3597.28s] Maybe not in a complete picture.
[3597.28s - 3599.84s] Maybe you have the family you always wished for.
[3599.84s - 3601.56s] Maybe you're on the career path
[3601.56s - 3603.59s] that you've worked really hard for.
[3603.59s - 3607.03s] Maybe you're sitting in the home
[3607.03s - 3610.27s] that you couldn't even have imagined living in.
[3610.27s - 3612.19s] But there's a part of your life
[3612.19s - 3614.91s] that is exactly the life that you wanted.
[3614.91s - 3617.58s] Not all of it, but there's a part of it.
[3617.58s - 3619.78s] And when you forget that,
[3619.78s - 3622.61s] you lose out on recognizing
[3622.61s - 3624.81s] you're already living in the dream.

[3624.81s - 3627.25s] And that you already have the power
[3627.25s - 3629.09s] to create that future dream
[3629.09s - 3631.69s] because you've already done it once.
[3631.69s - 3633.29s] So you have to remember
[3633.29s - 3634.89s] that where you are today
[3634.89s - 3636.73s] is what you wanted yesterday.
[3636.73s - 3637.89s] And what you want today,
[3637.89s - 3639.37s] you can create tomorrow
[3639.37s - 3641.49s] because you've already done it once.
[3641.49s - 3643.73s] But we forget it so quickly.
[3643.73s - 3646.25s] I have to remind myself all the time now.
[3646.25s - 3651.86s] I was driving to one of my friends' homes the other day.
[3652.30s - 3654.50s] And this is a friend
[3654.50s - 3657.74s] that I used to grow up watching on television,
[3657.74s - 3661.14s] watching their movies, listening to their music.
[3661.14s - 3665.01s] And they've become one of my closest friends in life.
[3665.01s - 3666.61s] And I had to pinch myself,

[3666.61s - 3668.37s] now we've been friends for like seven years,
[3668.37s - 3669.81s] I had to pinch myself to be like,
[3669.81s - 3671.45s] do I know what I'm doing?
[3671.45s - 3673.25s] Like I have to go back
[3673.25s - 3675.45s] to being at the beginning of that journey
[3675.45s - 3678.01s] because otherwise you can take anything for granted.
[3678.01s - 3679.81s] It's like you get to the top of a mountain
[3679.81s - 3683.13s] after a long hike and you look at a view,
[3683.13s - 3684.61s] you can get really familiar
[3684.61s - 3687.41s] and bored of that view really, really quick
[3687.41s - 3690.93s] unless you recognize the challenge it took,
[3690.93s - 3694.21s] the steps you took, the person you saw on the way up,
[3694.21s - 3696.69s] you have to sit there and remember all of that.
[3696.69s - 3698.25s] But the memory does this weird thing
[3698.25s - 3699.57s] where it just forgets it.
[3699.57s - 3701.89s] As soon as you achieve something,

[3701.89s - 3705.17s] you forget how you dreamt of achieving it.
[3705.17s - 3707.09s] As soon as you get somewhere,
[3707.09s - 3710.21s] you forget how once upon a time
[3710.21s - 3712.69s] you couldn't even imagine getting there.
[3712.69s - 3716.07s] Where you are today is what you wanted yesterday.
[3716.07s - 3717.83s] And don't forget how you got there
[3717.83s - 3720.15s] because that's the hidden secret
[3720.15s - 3721.63s] of how you get to the next place.
[3722.98s - 3725.26s] How do you use gratitude
[3727.36s - 3730.48s] to lift yourself up in a moment
[3730.48s - 3733.64s] that is extraordinarily difficult?
[3733.64s - 3736.20s] You're grieving, you're in the middle of a breakup
[3736.20s - 3738.20s] or a divorce, you've lost your job.
[3738.20s - 3741.72s] Is there a way to use gratitude to lift yourself up
[3741.72s - 3744.92s] when life just really has knocked you down?
[3744.92s - 3747.14s] When life's knocked you down,

[3747.14s - 3750.38s] it's hard to be grateful
[3750.42s - 3752.02s] for the good things in your life.
[3753.02s - 3755.38s] And it's sometimes bad advice
[3755.38s - 3757.90s] because someone's just lost a marriage,
[3757.90s - 3760.22s] lost a family member, whatever it may be.
[3760.22s - 3762.30s] So there's the time for grieving, of course.
[3762.30s - 3763.14s] Absolutely.
[3763.14s - 3764.70s] And that's the mentally healthy response
[3764.70s - 3767.50s] to have the avalanche of emotions.
[3767.50s - 3769.54s] But if you're gonna be grateful,
[3769.54s - 3773.14s] you sometimes have to do a counterintuitive practice.
[3773.14s - 3776.30s] Instead of being grateful for what you have,
[3776.30s - 3779.70s] think about how your life would be without something.
[3779.70s - 3783.90s] I find that to be the greatest thing for gratitude.
[3783.90s - 3786.22s] If I try and be grateful for something
[3786.22s - 3787.94s] that I've had for a long time,

[3787.94s - 3790.46s] I may get bored of it, I may be familiar with it.
[3790.46s - 3793.62s] But if I ask myself, what would my life be without that?
[3793.62s - 3796.94s] Oh my gosh, all of a sudden, I'm so grateful.
[3796.94s - 3798.58s] What would my life be without?
[3798.58s - 3800.46s] Have you ever had it where you just like
[3800.46s - 3803.14s] hurt your little finger or like get a little cut?
[3803.14s - 3805.74s] And now you can't use a finger or you can't use a thumb.
[3805.74s - 3806.58s] And all of a sudden you're like,
[3806.58s - 3808.82s] oh my God, I'm so grateful for my hand.
[3808.82s - 3810.82s] Because what would my life be like without it?
[3810.82s - 3813.06s] This is the way we have to trick our mind.
[3813.06s - 3815.46s] Humans are better at noticing something
[3815.46s - 3816.50s] when it's about to go away.
[3816.50s - 3817.82s] We always hear the phrase,
[3817.82s - 3820.18s] you don't know what you've got until it's gone.

[3820.18s - 3822.74s] So we have to use that in our favor to think,
[3822.74s - 3825.26s] not what do I have that I'm so grateful for,
[3825.26s - 3826.90s] what could I not live without?
[3826.90s - 3828.82s] That is life-changing.
[3828.82s - 3830.46s] I've never actually thought about it like that.
[3830.46s - 3832.42s] I was sitting there with a moment you said it
[3832.42s - 3837.01s] and I thought, how would I feel if Jay wasn't in my life?
[3837.01s - 3839.29s] And I'm grateful for you.
[3839.29s - 3843.73s] But the second I envisioned you, sorry Jay, evaporating
[3843.73s - 3847.29s] and not knowing you as a friend, it's like it 10-exted.
[3847.29s - 3850.81s] And even the example of, you know, you said the finger,
[3850.81s - 3853.25s] like I was in the hotel the other night
[3853.25s - 3855.65s] and I was walking to the bathroom, of course,
[3855.65s - 3858.41s] it's a 56-year-old woman at three o'clock in the morning.
[3858.41s - 3860.69s] And I hit my toe on the bed frame.

[3860.69s - 3863.37s] You're gonna be like, oh, and it feels like
[3863.37s - 3865.29s] you've ripped it off your foot.
[3866.28s - 3870.52s] It's amazing to me that my experience of that is,
[3870.52s - 3872.88s] you know, screaming an agony and then thinking,
[3872.88s - 3875.44s] how can something so little hurt so much?
[3875.44s - 3880.00s] And your reframe is imagine my life without my foot
[3880.00s - 3881.92s] and the gratitude that floods you.
[3881.92s - 3884.12s] I mean, that's incredible, Jay.
[3884.12s - 3885.24s] It really works.
[3885.24s - 3886.08s] It really works.
[3886.08s - 3887.24s] It really works. It's so simple.
[3887.24s - 3889.96s] And, you know, you can apply it to small and big things,
[3889.96s - 3892.48s] but even I was thinking as you were saying friendship,
[3892.48s - 3894.24s] I was thinking about our friend Dave Hollis.
[3894.24s - 3895.24s] Oh, yeah.
[3895.24s - 3900.16s] And, you know, it's, I know you spoke at his funeral

[3900.16s - 3901.68s] and I sadly couldn't be there,
[3901.68s - 3903.52s] but as I'm thinking about it,
[3903.52s - 3904.84s] I'm like, I was grateful for Dave.
[3904.84s - 3907.20s] I had some really beautiful interactions with Dave.
[3907.20s - 3908.32s] I really did.
[3908.32s - 3910.70s] He was a wonderful man.
[3910.70s - 3912.98s] But it's only when you sadly lose someone
[3912.98s - 3914.54s] that you really recognize, wait a minute,
[3914.54s - 3915.86s] I can't call them again.
[3915.86s - 3917.38s] I'm not gonna get a call from him again.
[3917.38s - 3919.62s] I'm not gonna see him at our next get together.
[3919.62s - 3920.94s] And then all of a sudden, so like,
[3920.94s - 3922.22s] do that while people are here.
[3922.22s - 3923.38s] And it's not a fear thing.
[3923.42s - 3925.26s] It's a gratitude thing, right?
[3925.26s - 3926.74s] It's not like I'm living in fear
[3926.74s - 3928.66s] of what if I lose this person.
[3928.66s - 3929.70s] You're asking yourself,

[3929.70s - 3933.34s] what would my life be without this?
[3933.34s - 3935.14s] Oh my gosh, I'm so glad I have it.
[3935.14s - 3936.46s] I'm so grateful I have it.
[3936.46s - 3939.54s] I'm so lucky and fortunate I get to have this.
[3939.54s - 3942.18s] That's what you're fueling your life with, not with fear.
[3942.18s - 3945.90s] I really, I want to thank you for that.
[3945.90s - 3949.42s] Because especially that last part about you can actually
[3949.42s - 3951.38s] kind of do things out of fear
[3951.38s - 3955.22s] or you can have the fuel and the energizing source of it.
[3955.22s - 3956.78s] Be gratitude and I'll give you an example.
[3956.78s - 3957.62s] Please.
[3957.62s - 3960.46s] So my dad is 80 years old.
[3960.46s - 3964.46s] And I think a lot about the fact that if I'm lucky,
[3964.46s - 3967.50s] I'm gonna get 10 more, maybe 15 more.
[3967.50s - 3969.38s] If I'm crazy lucky.
[3970.94s - 3973.70s] Holidays with him, birthdays with him.

[3973.70s - 3975.98s] And I realize as I'm listening to you
[3975.98s - 3979.84s] that I've been coming from this sense of fear
[3979.84s - 3981.60s] because there's this sense like,
[3981.60s - 3983.20s] I gotta make the most of the time that I have
[3983.20s - 3984.84s] while I have the time.
[3984.84s - 3987.84s] And I can take what you just shared
[3987.84s - 3992.16s] and say, I am so grateful that he's here.
[3992.16s - 3996.68s] That I want to make use of the time that I have
[3996.68s - 3998.40s] while he's here.
[3998.40s - 4002.80s] Which is a very different energy to ground yourself in.
[4002.80s - 4004.04s] You're so right, you're spot on.
[4004.04s - 4007.92s] It's this idea of having the full picture.
[4007.92s - 4008.76s] Talk more about that.
[4008.80s - 4010.68s] Yeah.
[4010.68s - 4013.60s] And I want to approach it from a really interesting take.
[4013.60s - 4015.16s] And it comes from what we're talking about

[4015.16s - 4017.75s] a few seconds ago around comparison.
[4017.75s - 4020.43s] So Mel, there's only really,
[4020.43s - 4022.35s] apart from what we said about how to turn jealousy,
[4022.35s - 4026.23s] which I love, there's really only one way
[4026.23s - 4029.02s] to overcome comparison.
[4029.02s - 4031.58s] And it's having the full picture
[4031.58s - 4034.65s] of the person you compare yourself to.
[4034.65s - 4036.53s] You've got to know what's happening
[4036.53s - 4039.33s] behind their perfect Instagram posts.
[4039.33s - 4042.21s] Do you know how many times they cried themselves
[4042.21s - 4044.17s] to sleep this week?
[4044.17s - 4046.09s] Do you know the argument they just had
[4046.09s - 4048.22s] with their mom last night?
[4048.22s - 4049.62s] Do you know the challenge they're going through
[4049.62s - 4051.64s] with their kids right now?
[4051.64s - 4054.92s] Do you know about the family member who has an illness?

[4054.92s - 4056.88s] All of a sudden when you actually get
[4056.88s - 4059.93s] the full picture on someone's life,
[4059.93s - 4062.37s] you now don't compare yourself to them
[4062.37s - 4065.25s] because you realize no one's life is perfect.
[4065.25s - 4067.82s] They're just better at cropping out the pain.
[4067.82s - 4069.66s] They're just better at editing out the parts
[4069.66s - 4072.06s] that they don't want you to see.
[4072.06s - 4075.50s] But when you see what someone's really going through,
[4075.50s - 4078.22s] all of a sudden you won't compare it anymore
[4078.22s - 4079.94s] because you recognize everyone's
[4079.94s - 4081.58s] going through something difficult.
[4081.58s - 4083.70s] Jay, another thing that you remind us all
[4083.70s - 4085.74s] that I just love is the bad times reveal
[4085.74s - 4088.58s] who the great people are in your life.
[4088.58s - 4091.58s] Do people show up for you
[4091.58s - 4094.22s] when you're going through a bad day?

[4094.22s - 4097.42s] Are people present for your good days
[4097.42s - 4100.32s] but absent for your bad days?
[4100.32s - 4103.32s] Do people turn up, call, check in
[4103.32s - 4105.37s] when things are going wrong?
[4105.37s - 4109.09s] Does someone see the best in you
[4109.09s - 4111.40s] when you're your worst self?
[4111.40s - 4113.91s] Does someone see the good in you
[4113.91s - 4116.41s] when you might be having a bad day?
[4116.41s - 4119.29s] That person is more special
[4119.29s - 4121.43s] than anyone you'll ever meet.
[4121.43s - 4123.65s] So keep them close.
[4123.65s - 4126.89s] Don't run the risk of pushing them away,
[4126.89s - 4130.59s] losing them, taking them for granted
[4130.59s - 4133.35s] because one day you'll wish
[4133.35s - 4137.31s] that they'll call and check in
[4137.31s - 4140.82s] and you might have lost them by then.
[4140.82s - 4144.18s] So the bad times in our life
[4144.18s - 4147.65s] genuinely show us the great people

[4147.65s - 4149.41s] because it's at that point
[4149.41s - 4151.21s] that you're hard to support,
[4151.21s - 4152.93s] you're hard to love,
[4152.93s - 4154.89s] you're hard to give energy to,
[4154.89s - 4157.61s] it might not be popular to be your friend
[4157.61s - 4159.17s] which what does that prove?
[4159.17s - 4162.05s] It proves that person values you
[4162.05s - 4163.85s] more than popularity.
[4163.85s - 4166.05s] It proves that person values you
[4166.05s - 4167.81s] more than their reputation.
[4167.81s - 4170.82s] It proves that that person values you
[4170.82s - 4174.26s] more than all the stress.
[4174.26s - 4177.38s] That is the most special person you'll ever meet
[4177.38s - 4179.78s] and everyone has at least one of them
[4179.78s - 4182.70s] but the problem is we want attention from these people
[4182.70s - 4185.81s] so we lose affection from these people.
[4185.81s - 4187.01s] It's so true.
[4187.01s - 4188.85s] You're really good at that.

[4188.85s - 4192.63s] You're really good at showing up for your friends.
[4192.63s - 4195.13s] It's because people have shown up for me.
[4195.13s - 4196.49s] That's the reality of it.
[4196.49s - 4198.37s] I'm good at showing up for people
[4198.37s - 4200.09s] because people have shown up for me
[4200.09s - 4202.13s] and it's not always the same people.
[4202.13s - 4203.45s] That's the mistake we make.
[4203.45s - 4205.69s] We think that the people we show up for
[4205.69s - 4208.13s] should be the people that show up back for us.
[4208.13s - 4209.25s] Oh, say more about that.
[4209.25s - 4212.93s] So we believe that when we show up for someone
[4212.93s - 4214.69s] they should show up for us.
[4214.69s - 4217.61s] We want people to love us
[4217.61s - 4220.09s] in the same way we love them
[4220.09s - 4223.33s] but people won't love you the way you love them.
[4223.33s - 4226.89s] And that's okay because there's someone over here
[4226.89s - 4228.65s] who's showing up for you

[4228.65s - 4230.37s] and you're missing out on them.
[4230.37s - 4232.45s] There's someone over here who's turning up for you
[4232.45s - 4233.85s] who's checking in on you.
[4233.85s - 4235.93s] I remember saying to my monk teacher,
[4235.93s - 4239.37s] I said, I feel like I give so much love to others.
[4239.37s - 4242.93s] I said, I feel like I show up so much for other people
[4242.93s - 4245.54s] but they don't show up for me.
[4245.54s - 4247.33s] What do I do?
[4247.33s - 4250.17s] And he said, love is like a circle.
[4250.17s - 4254.33s] Whatever love you give out will always come back to you
[4254.33s - 4256.25s] but it might just not be from those people
[4256.25s - 4258.13s] you gave it to in the first place.
[4258.13s - 4260.77s] But if you spend your whole life wondering
[4260.77s - 4263.61s] why that person doesn't give you love back,
[4263.61s - 4266.29s] you're ignoring all these people over here
[4266.29s - 4268.77s] who give you love all the time.

[4268.77s - 4271.53s] So turn around, look around you.
[4271.53s - 4273.73s] There is someone who's showing up for you,
[4273.73s - 4276.21s] turning up for you, checking in with you
[4276.21s - 4278.64s] even when you don't acknowledge them
[4278.68s - 4280.20s] and start looking towards that person
[4280.20s - 4281.84s] and giving them some respect.
[4281.84s - 4283.36s] I want to dig deeper into that.
[4283.36s - 4284.12s] Yeah, please.
[4284.12s - 4289.41s] Because I feel like relationships
[4289.89s - 4292.69s] have become extremely transactional.
[4292.69s - 4295.17s] If I check in on you, you got to check in on me.
[4295.17s - 4296.53s] That's the sign that you care.
[4296.53s - 4299.45s] And I love what you just said
[4299.45s - 4300.69s] that there are going to be times
[4300.69s - 4302.49s] where you show up for people
[4302.49s - 4304.57s] and they're not going to show up for you
[4304.57s - 4305.73s] either because they can't

[4305.73s - 4307.45s] or they don't know what's going on
[4307.53s - 4309.13s] or they got other things going on
[4309.13s - 4311.41s] or they're not actually the right person
[4311.41s - 4314.16s] to support you right now.
[4314.16s - 4317.28s] And them showing up feels more like a,
[4317.28s - 4318.64s] is going to feel more like a burden.
[4318.64s - 4320.92s] And so maybe that's also spiritually speaking,
[4320.92s - 4322.68s] why they're not showing up.
[4322.68s - 4325.16s] And I love the fact that if you think about love
[4325.16s - 4329.42s] like a circle and you show up because that's who you are.
[4329.42s - 4332.74s] And in those moments when you need support,
[4332.74s - 4334.90s] recognize that there actually are people
[4334.90s - 4337.66s] around you trying to support you
[4337.66s - 4339.98s] or that are capable of it
[4339.98s - 4343.74s] if you simply let them know that you need it.
[4343.74s - 4346.30s] That's a completely different way to think about things

[4346.30s - 4349.18s] because we keep score in relationships.
[4349.18s - 4350.94s] And that if I'm the one that's always reaching out
[4350.94s - 4355.46s] to my siblings, that if they don't reach back to me
[4355.46s - 4357.82s] that it means they don't care.
[4357.82s - 4361.06s] And sometimes it actually just means
[4361.06s - 4363.26s] that's not how they express their love.
[4363.26s - 4364.26s] Yes.
[4364.26s - 4368.06s] And that the thing that you're seeking from them
[4368.06s - 4370.58s] actually is going to come from a friend.
[4370.58s - 4373.78s] And if you're keeping score in your relationships,
[4373.78s - 4376.94s] you're actually the one that's going to destroy them.
[4376.94s - 4378.15s] Yes.
[4378.15s - 4380.39s] Can you dig into that with me, Jay?
[4380.39s - 4381.43s] That's powerful, Mel.
[4381.43s - 4384.55s] I love what you're saying and it's so true.
[4384.55s - 4389.19s] It's the first thing we have to ask ourselves is,

[4389.19s - 4392.15s] did I show up for you for you
[4392.15s - 4394.59s] or did I show up for you for me?
[4394.59s - 4395.79s] What do you mean?
[4395.79s - 4397.75s] If I'm showing up for you for you,
[4397.75s - 4400.31s] then I don't need you to show up back for me.
[4400.31s - 4403.51s] But if I showed up to prove to you that I showed up,
[4403.51s - 4405.31s] now I need you to show up back for me
[4405.31s - 4407.83s] to prove to me that I did the right thing.
[4407.83s - 4409.95s] It's almost like an insecurity of like,
[4409.95s - 4412.39s] I'm doing it because I expect you to do it back,
[4412.39s - 4413.87s] which is what you said at the beginning.
[4413.87s - 4415.68s] It's transactional.
[4415.68s - 4418.18s] If I do something for you
[4418.18s - 4422.02s] and I don't expect anything back, that's called love.
[4422.02s - 4425.34s] If I do something for you and I expect it back,
[4425.34s - 4428.46s] that's called a transaction, that's business.

[4428.46s - 4430.85s] That's a contract.
[4430.85s - 4434.09s] I don't want to have a contract with someone I love.
[4434.09s - 4436.13s] So why would I be measuring them
[4436.13s - 4439.49s] based on how they do the exact same thing back for me?
[4439.49s - 4441.85s] If you think about that, let's say Mel,
[4441.85s - 4443.57s] I organized your birthday party
[4443.57s - 4446.13s] because I love organizing birthday parties.
[4446.13s - 4449.25s] Does that mean you have to organize my birthday party
[4449.25s - 4451.69s] to show me you love me equally?
[4451.69s - 4453.77s] What if you didn't organize my birthday party
[4453.77s - 4457.49s] but you called me when I had a really tough day at work
[4457.49s - 4458.57s] and you checked in with me
[4458.57s - 4460.77s] and gave me some great wisdom and insight?
[4460.77s - 4462.29s] Is that equal?
[4462.29s - 4464.57s] Or actually, do I see that as not equal
[4464.57s - 4467.41s] because you didn't spend seven days or seven months

[4467.41s - 4468.57s] planning an event for me?
[4468.57s - 4470.25s] Now, are we counting time?
[4470.25s - 4472.25s] Or are we measuring emotion?
[4472.25s - 4473.85s] How do you value to?
[4473.85s - 4475.73s] I can't value you based on the hours
[4475.73s - 4476.65s] you put into our friendship.
[4476.65s - 4478.53s] Let's say that I was struggling something
[4478.53s - 4480.83s] and you sent me a text.
[4480.83s - 4482.71s] But when you were struggling, I called you up.
[4482.71s - 4484.39s] Does that mean I care more about you?
[4484.39s - 4486.79s] Or was that text just perfect for what I needed?
[4486.79s - 4489.75s] We're measuring these very immeasurable things.
[4489.75s - 4494.27s] Are we counting days, hours, months, emotions, laughs?
[4494.27s - 4496.19s] What are you gonna keep a score on?
[4496.19s - 4498.19s] And so I think we're keeping a score on things
[4498.19s - 4499.87s] that you can't measure.

[4499.87s - 4504.27s] And this is one of the limits I have with the love languages.
[4504.27s - 4506.63s] I actually don't want you to love me
[4506.63s - 4508.67s] the way I wanna be loved.
[4508.67s - 4510.31s] Like, what do you mean by that?
[4510.31s - 4513.39s] I believe that if I want you to love me
[4513.39s - 4516.27s] exactly the way I want to be loved,
[4516.27s - 4519.19s] I'm actually limiting how much you can love me.
[4519.19s - 4521.80s] Because you have something to offer me
[4521.80s - 4525.60s] that is different to what I even know I can receive.
[4525.60s - 4526.60s] So if I say to you,
[4526.60s - 4529.44s] now the only way you can show me love is gifts,
[4529.44s - 4532.02s] because that's what blows my mind.
[4532.02s - 4534.30s] That's great, I do like gifts.
[4534.30s - 4535.14s] But guess what?
[4535.14s - 4539.10s] What if your best way to offer love is acts of service?
[4539.10s - 4542.54s] What if your best way of love is quality time?

[4542.54s - 4546.62s] Now I'm gonna miss out on the greatness you have to offer me
[4546.62s - 4547.46s] because I'm gonna say,
[4547.46s - 4549.06s] I only want you to give me this.
[4549.06s - 4551.06s] What if you wanted to give me the world?
[4551.06s - 4552.62s] And I said, just give me a gift.
[4552.62s - 4556.54s] So I'm limiting, I'm limiting how much love.
[4556.54s - 4560.02s] So when love matures, I think when love is young,
[4560.02s - 4561.70s] it's a great principle.
[4561.70s - 4563.54s] But when love matures,
[4564.54s - 4566.14s] and by the way, me and Radi have been through this.
[4566.14s - 4568.82s] When I met Radi, I was that guy, so I love gifts.
[4568.82s - 4570.30s] And I had to do a lot of unpacking
[4570.30s - 4571.54s] as to why I love gifts.
[4571.54s - 4572.58s] Why do you love gifts?
[4572.58s - 4575.10s] It's because my mum couldn't always be there
[4575.10s - 4575.94s] for me on my birthday.
[4575.94s - 4576.86s] We couldn't spend quality time.

[4576.86s - 4578.38s] She was working, she was the breadwinner,
[4578.38s - 4579.82s] but she always got me that one gift.
[4579.82s - 4582.06s] I'd come home and the power ranger would be wrapped up there
[4582.06s - 4584.34s] and I'd unwrap it and I'd have so much joy.
[4584.34s - 4587.34s] So when I met Radi, Radi comes from a family
[4587.34s - 4589.62s] where quality time is the gift.
[4589.62s - 4591.06s] They don't really give each other gifts,
[4591.06s - 4592.66s] which to me when I first met her, I was like,
[4592.66s - 4593.82s] this is bizarre.
[4593.82s - 4595.82s] What is wrong with all of you?
[4595.82s - 4598.54s] And I wanted, this is ridiculous,
[4598.54s - 4601.42s] but I remember the new iPad mini was out
[4601.42s - 4604.42s] and I'd kind of hinted to that I wanted this iPad mini.
[4604.42s - 4609.18s] Anyway, I unwrap my gift on my birthday and it's an Aces.
[4609.18s - 4611.18s] I was like, I want an iPad mini,
[4611.18s - 4612.82s] who gets someone an Aces?

[4612.82s - 4616.62s] And it sounds ridiculous,
[4616.62s - 4619.58s] but I'm telling it because of how ridiculous we can be.
[4619.58s - 4620.98s] And she literally said to me,
[4620.98s - 4622.54s] she was like, oh no, but I asked my family
[4622.54s - 4624.22s] and they said this one's got better specs
[4624.22s - 4626.14s] and it's actually better than the iPad
[4626.14s - 4627.10s] and it's better resolution.
[4627.18s - 4629.22s] And I was like, but I wanted the iPad.
[4629.22s - 4633.48s] And I'm telling this story because Radi and me
[4633.48s - 4636.32s] learned as our relationship developed
[4636.32s - 4639.52s] that Radi had so many beautiful ways to show me love
[4639.52s - 4642.52s] and she turned up in so many amazing ways,
[4642.52s - 4644.24s] but I would ignore all of them
[4644.24s - 4646.44s] because I didn't get a gift on my birthday
[4646.44s - 4648.56s] or the gift I wanted on my birthday.
[4648.56s - 4651.40s] And I think so many of us are ignoring

[4651.40s - 4654.84s] the amazing ways our partners, our kids,
[4654.84s - 4656.52s] our parents show up for us
[4656.52s - 4660.72s] because they don't show up in exactly the way we want.
[4660.72s - 4665.06s] And here's the point, no one will ever love you
[4665.06s - 4669.54s] exactly how you want because that's your job
[4669.54s - 4671.70s] and that's God's job.
[4671.70s - 4676.54s] We will wish, wait, want every single week, month and year
[4676.54s - 4679.98s] for someone to love us in a particular exact way
[4679.98s - 4683.62s] and they will always fail us because that was your job.
[4683.62s - 4685.22s] It was never theirs in the first place.
[4685.22s - 4688.18s] That was God's job, it was never theirs in the first place.
[4688.18s - 4691.22s] So open yourself up to the limitless love
[4691.22s - 4692.26s] that people show up.
[4692.26s - 4695.38s] Maybe your partner makes you coffee in the morning.
[4695.38s - 4697.78s] Maybe they're the ones that make the bed.

[4697.78s - 4699.26s] Maybe they're the one when you're on the road
[4699.26s - 4702.06s] to check in with you and order something to your hotel room.
[4702.06s - 4704.10s] Maybe they're the one that reminds you
[4704.10s - 4706.26s] that you forgot your glasses or your wallet.
[4706.26s - 4707.94s] Maybe they're the one that remembers
[4707.94s - 4711.06s] to put the dishes away, whatever it is.
[4711.06s - 4713.02s] They're doing something and it's love.
[4713.02s - 4714.34s] They may not say I love you,
[4714.34s - 4717.86s] it may not look like I love you, but it is.
[4717.86s - 4719.06s] And by the way, when you tell them,
[4719.06s - 4720.58s] hey, you didn't get me this one thing
[4720.58s - 4722.98s] or you didn't say this one thing,
[4722.98s - 4726.81s] they're thinking, how did you miss all of the other things?
[4726.81s - 4729.69s] And guess what, you discourage them from loving you.
[4729.69s - 4732.21s] You don't encourage someone to love you

[4732.21s - 4734.41s] by telling them you're disappointed.
[4734.41s - 4737.01s] No one's gonna give you more because you made them feel bad.
[4737.01s - 4740.05s] People love you more when they see you noticed
[4740.05s - 4742.13s] all the little things they did.
[4742.13s - 4746.67s] And all of a sudden, they feel inspired to give you more.
[4746.67s - 4753.69s] Jay, it really, as I was listening to you,
[4756.90s - 4758.78s] I was first of all thinking about what an asshole
[4758.78s - 4760.82s] I am in my marriage, so thanks a lot.
[4762.66s - 4763.98s] We love you, Chris.
[4765.82s - 4768.46s] Because I so saw myself, right?
[4768.46s - 4769.86s] Me too, by the way.
[4769.86s - 4774.68s] Yeah, and then something extraordinary happened
[4774.72s - 4775.92s] as I was listening to you.
[4780.03s - 4786.50s] And that is what a shame that most of us are so busy
[4788.74s - 4793.10s] looking for the one way we expect to be loved,

[4793.10s - 4796.42s] that we miss all of the love that is around us
[4796.42s - 4799.70s] and available to us that we don't let in.
[4799.70s - 4804.59s] And what an opportunity to have a shift
[4804.59s - 4810.68s] and really change the way that you see life
[4811.16s - 4817.02s] you see relationships and what you open yourself up to.
[4817.02s - 4822.18s] If there's one thing from that perspective
[4822.70s - 4824.50s] and what you learned about yourself
[4824.50s - 4826.14s] and what you learned about what's possible
[4826.14s - 4830.70s] that being loved the way you want to be loved is your job.
[4830.70s - 4833.06s] It's God's job, it's the universe's job.
[4833.06s - 4835.22s] It's not somebody else's job.
[4835.22s - 4840.57s] And I would say learning how to allow in
[4840.57s - 4843.29s] other people's expression of love
[4843.29s - 4845.73s] is a huge opportunity for you.
[4845.73s - 4849.77s] Whether it's your friends, whether it's your parents,

[4849.77s - 4853.57s] whether it's, you know, your kids, your partner, everybody.
[4853.57s - 4855.17s] Like, how do you do that?
[4855.17s - 4857.25s] Especially if you've been a first-class asshole,
[4857.25s - 4861.05s] like me, just been like, you didn't do it this way.
[4861.05s - 4863.89s] And I thought, yeah, like nobody texted me on the thing
[4863.89s - 4864.89s] and nobody checked in.
[4864.89s - 4868.45s] Like we're so focused on what's not happening
[4868.45s - 4871.37s] that you're blocking what actually is.
[4871.37s - 4874.49s] And then you just keep preventing it
[4874.49s - 4877.21s] from being an experience
[4877.21s - 4879.84s] it's available to you right now.
[4879.84s - 4880.84s] Thank you for sharing that.
[4880.84s - 4882.32s] And by the way, I feel the same way too.
[4882.32s - 4885.04s] It took me so many years of unpacking
[4885.04s - 4888.36s] to understand why I was so fixated.
[4888.36s - 4891.40s] But the way I think about it is

[4891.40s - 4896.04s] the person that texts you when they don't want anything,
[4896.04s - 4898.24s] don't forget that person.
[4898.24s - 4900.00s] The person who calls you
[4900.00s - 4904.10s] when they don't need anything, don't forget that person.
[4904.10s - 4908.00s] The person who comes over and swings by,
[4908.00s - 4913.09s] just a chat, even when you're busy, don't forget that person.
[4913.09s - 4917.29s] The person who walks in and remembered
[4917.29s - 4919.25s] that you had something happening at work
[4919.25s - 4920.61s] or something happening in your home
[4920.61s - 4924.49s] or something happening in your life, don't forget that person.
[4924.49s - 4929.49s] We do it by starting to recognize those people in our life
[4930.66s - 4935.24s] that are not big and crazy, but they're consistent.
[4935.24s - 4937.12s] The consistent people in our life
[4937.12s - 4939.32s] are the people that are forgotten.
[4939.32s - 4941.48s] The people who've become like furniture.

[4941.48s - 4943.60s] The people who've become so familiar.
[4943.60s - 4944.44s] But guess what?
[4944.44s - 4946.96s] They were the people that texted you when they needed nothing.
[4946.96s - 4949.28s] They're the people that called you when they wanted nothing.
[4949.28s - 4950.76s] They're the people that checked in with you
[4950.76s - 4953.71s] with no transaction required.
[4953.71s - 4955.47s] Take a moment to just think of that person
[4955.47s - 4958.19s] and messes them now and don't ask for anything.
[4958.19s - 4959.66s] Just tell them.
[4959.66s - 4961.22s] Tell them how you feel.
[4961.22s - 4965.30s] Messes them and say, thank you so much for showing up for me
[4965.30s - 4967.06s] when you didn't want anything in return.
[4967.06s - 4970.02s] Thank you so much for checking in with me
[4970.02s - 4971.94s] when you got nothing out of it.
[4971.94s - 4973.74s] I acknowledge them for that
[4973.74s - 4975.74s] because we have to start noticing it.

[4975.74s - 4977.02s] We have to start noticing it.
[4977.02s - 4978.42s] It's so easy.
[4978.42s - 4980.58s] And this is why I have this habit
[4980.58s - 4984.02s] that whenever I think of someone, I send them a message.
[4984.02s - 4986.86s] Whatever my thought may be, I'll send them a message.
[4986.86s - 4989.70s] And the message will just say, thinking of you, Mel,
[4989.70s - 4992.05s] sending you lots of love.
[4992.05s - 4994.01s] And I do it all the time.
[4994.01s - 4996.81s] The amount of times in the last month
[4996.81s - 4999.73s] that that person has responded to me immediately
[4999.73s - 5002.29s] and said, I was just talking about you.
[5002.29s - 5004.53s] I was just thinking about you.
[5004.53s - 5007.77s] Oh my gosh, I was just sharing something you put online
[5007.77s - 5010.01s] or shared on Instagram or whatever it may have been.
[5010.01s - 5011.45s] The amount of times that's happened
[5011.45s - 5014.08s] is truly blowing my mind.

[5014.08s - 5016.76s] And I've realized because you know
[5016.76s - 5019.32s] we all have this sense, you and I,
[5019.32s - 5021.52s] all of us, everyone who's listening and watching right now
[5021.52s - 5025.30s] has this intuition when someone needs us.
[5025.30s - 5026.82s] But we're scared.
[5026.82s - 5029.66s] We're scared to message with no reason.
[5029.66s - 5031.38s] We're scared we might be disrupting someone
[5031.38s - 5032.54s] or they're too busy.
[5032.54s - 5033.62s] We're scared, but no, no, no.
[5033.62s - 5035.22s] That's what that person wants.
[5035.22s - 5038.06s] That person wants you to just send love when they're busy.
[5038.06s - 5040.58s] That person wants you to say hello
[5040.58s - 5041.74s] when they're having a crazy day
[5041.74s - 5042.58s] because guess what?
[5042.58s - 5043.82s] You're the only person doing that.
[5043.82s - 5045.10s] Everyone else is asking for something
[5045.10s - 5047.75s] or wants something from them.

[5047.75s - 5048.91s] The best time to message someone
[5048.91s - 5050.47s] is when you don't want anything.
[5050.47s - 5052.47s] You actually talk about this a lot online,
[5052.47s - 5053.87s] the power of calling somebody,
[5053.87s - 5055.43s] the power of texting somebody
[5055.43s - 5058.31s] and how much we underestimate this small action.
[5058.31s - 5062.84s] And you also said that we have this amazing sense
[5062.84s - 5065.80s] to sense when somebody needs you.
[5065.80s - 5070.46s] And what I would ask us all to consider
[5070.46s - 5074.46s] is that the people that you care about always need you
[5074.46s - 5079.91s] and that check-in is you doing something that we all need,
[5080.79s - 5084.75s] which is this small act of loving somebody
[5084.75s - 5087.55s] and seeing them and just saying,
[5087.55s - 5088.63s] I have you in mind.
[5088.63s - 5092.35s] One of the reasons why I always tell the person
[5092.35s - 5093.55s] who's listening that I love them

[5093.55s - 5097.11s] is because I think we just vastly inflate
[5097.11s - 5098.79s] what that word actually means.
[5098.79s - 5101.59s] And to me, when you look at the word love,
[5101.59s - 5102.59s] it's two things.
[5102.59s - 5105.47s] It's you admire something in someone else,
[5105.47s - 5109.51s] some quality, some characteristic, something about them.
[5109.51s - 5111.87s] And you consider them, you have them in mind.
[5111.87s - 5114.51s] And if you admire somebody,
[5114.51s - 5115.75s] something about their values,
[5115.75s - 5117.27s] something about how they show up in life,
[5117.27s - 5120.83s] something about who they are, what they mean to you,
[5120.83s - 5123.67s] and you have them in mind to your point,
[5123.67s - 5126.51s] sending a text, just to say I was just thinking about you,
[5126.51s - 5129.63s] making somebody a cup of coffee with the cashew milk
[5129.63s - 5131.35s] because that's what they care about.

[5131.39s - 5134.10s] That's actually an act of love, it is.
[5134.10s - 5138.38s] And if we go all the way back to the janitors in the hospital
[5138.38s - 5140.22s] who say that they are healers,
[5140.22s - 5145.22s] because they believe that having a clean space
[5145.50s - 5148.50s] for families to gather, for people to heal
[5148.50s - 5153.50s] is a sacred thing to do for the healing process,
[5153.58s - 5158.09s] then you are demonstrating an act of love.
[5158.09s - 5159.57s] How do you think about love?
[5159.57s - 5162.57s] I don't think about love, such a beautiful and big question.
[5162.57s - 5166.41s] Because I feel like we're coming out of this conversation
[5166.41s - 5168.57s] about how we block it,
[5168.57s - 5171.85s] because we're expecting it to be expressed in a certain way,
[5171.85s - 5174.49s] and that it is all around you.
[5174.49s - 5176.69s] And you're a person in my life
[5176.69s - 5179.89s] that you show up that way.

[5179.89s - 5184.54s] I mean, there's what you do, which is your job.
[5184.54s - 5189.10s] And the things that you are doing
[5189.14s - 5194.71s] that is in service of the world, but it's not who you are.
[5194.71s - 5196.99s] And my experience of you is somebody
[5196.99s - 5199.87s] who is the expression of love.
[5199.87s - 5202.47s] Thank you, Sophie, that touches my heart.
[5207.80s - 5209.00s] I think what you just said,
[5209.00s - 5212.30s] there's even more interesting about blocking love.
[5212.30s - 5218.97s] If you still see your mom calling, that's a blessing.
[5219.33s - 5222.94s] If you still see your dad's name on your phone,
[5222.94s - 5227.17s] sending you a text, that's a blessing.
[5227.21s - 5228.73s] 10 years from now,
[5228.73s - 5232.49s] you're not gonna remember the meeting you were in.
[5232.49s - 5234.05s] 20 years from now,
[5234.05s - 5238.39s] you're not gonna remember the task you were doing.
[5238.39s - 5240.39s] That's how we block love.

[5240.39s - 5242.31s] We block love, because when it's coming in,
[5242.31s - 5246.08s] when it's coming freely, when it's coming unlimitedly,
[5246.08s - 5248.12s] we don't know how to hold on to it.
[5248.12s - 5251.76s] There's this beautiful poem from India
[5251.76s - 5257.06s] that says, when God wants to give us something,
[5257.06s - 5260.90s] how much can these two little hands hold on to?
[5260.90s - 5264.33s] And when things are taken away from us,
[5264.33s - 5267.60s] how much can these two little hands hold on to?
[5267.60s - 5272.60s] And it's this beautiful idea of God's ever-flowing love
[5273.86s - 5275.58s] that's unlimitedly there,
[5275.58s - 5278.63s] and we can just try to catch and hold whatever we can.
[5278.63s - 5279.63s] And at the same time,
[5279.63s - 5282.46s] and when something's going away,
[5282.46s - 5284.02s] there's an insignificance that we have
[5284.02s - 5286.67s] where we can't hold on to anymore.
[5286.67s - 5288.38s] So what do we do?

[5288.38s - 5291.71s] We pick up the court, we return it,
[5291.71s - 5293.80s] we message back.
[5293.80s - 5295.24s] We don't block it by saying,
[5295.24s - 5297.84s] oh, they just keep connecting.
[5297.84s - 5299.72s] Oh, that person just keeps calling.
[5299.72s - 5301.00s] Oh, that person just,
[5301.00s - 5305.19s] the amount of people that are blocking love,
[5305.19s - 5308.19s] because they're thinking, that person's needy,
[5308.19s - 5309.95s] or that person's desperate,
[5309.95s - 5314.03s] or that person's not cool enough to be my friend,
[5314.03s - 5317.67s] or that person's not interesting enough to be my friend.
[5317.67s - 5321.71s] I know so many people today that are leaving friendships
[5321.71s - 5323.35s] and relationships behind,
[5323.35s - 5325.99s] because the person's not cool enough, smart enough,
[5325.99s - 5328.23s] talented enough, whatever it is,
[5328.23s - 5330.43s] because when someone shows and wears their heart

[5330.43s - 5334.08s] on their sleeve, we see that as a weakness.
[5334.08s - 5338.04s] We believe that love is chasing someone
[5338.04s - 5341.64s] rather than wanting someone who never wants to leave.
[5341.64s - 5346.64s] We would rather chase, pursue, and court someone
[5347.16s - 5350.32s] because we believe that love has to be earned
[5350.32s - 5352.80s] rather than receive it freely
[5352.80s - 5354.96s] from all of these people around us
[5354.96s - 5357.48s] who are giving it to us unlimitedly,
[5357.48s - 5362.16s] because we think that love is valuable if it's rare.
[5362.16s - 5364.24s] We believe that love is valuable
[5364.24s - 5366.32s] if it's given in small doses.
[5366.32s - 5368.28s] If someone's holding it back a little,
[5368.28s - 5371.52s] it feels like power, and that feels like love to us,
[5371.52s - 5373.56s] but that's not love, it's control.
[5373.56s - 5376.16s] That's not love, it's manipulation.

[5376.16s - 5378.72s] That's not a partnership, it's ownership.
[5378.72s - 5381.12s] So if you're looking for a relationship,
[5381.12s - 5383.44s] love should just flow freely.
[5383.44s - 5385.40s] Love is not measured, it's not calculated,
[5385.40s - 5388.52s] it's not counted, it's not some algorithm,
[5388.52s - 5391.32s] it's not a number, it's completely
[5391.32s - 5393.84s] a free-flowing energetic force,
[5393.84s - 5396.40s] and it is in your life, it is flowing within you,
[5396.40s - 5400.72s] you are made of it, you are actually made of it,
[5400.72s - 5403.76s] and it is flowing freely within you to you at all times,
[5403.76s - 5406.13s] it's why you are alive.
[5406.13s - 5407.89s] But if you block it,
[5407.89s - 5411.33s] it's like when the sun's out and you turn the blinds down,
[5411.33s - 5416.33s] the sun is freely showering its rays onto every single home,
[5416.81s - 5418.53s] the sun does not discriminate,

[5418.53s - 5421.93s] the sun will freely give its sun to everyone,
[5421.93s - 5426.42s] but if you put the shades down, you're blocking it,
[5426.42s - 5427.26s] don't do that.
[5428.25s - 5431.81s] There's so many people that feel isolated and lonely, Jay,
[5433.17s - 5435.25s] if somebody's listening and they're like,
[5435.25s - 5437.17s] the shades are down, Jay,
[5437.17s - 5440.32s] and there aren't people in my life.
[5440.32s - 5443.20s] What is one thing somebody can do that recognizes
[5443.20s - 5446.30s] that the shades are drawn, for whatever reason?
[5446.30s - 5449.66s] How do you start to crank it back up
[5449.66s - 5453.82s] and let all of that that is available to you, friendship,
[5453.82s - 5458.14s] love, connection, possibility, hope, all of it?
[5458.14s - 5460.58s] What's one thing that somebody could do?
[5460.58s - 5464.14s] Be that person, be the person to text someone love,
[5464.14s - 5467.14s] be the person to call in and check in on someone,

[5467.14s - 5468.78s] even if they don't check in on you.
[5468.78s - 5472.34s] Be the person who goes and helps someone with their groceries
[5472.34s - 5473.26s] because they need it.
[5473.26s - 5476.42s] Be the person who goes and gives love to others,
[5476.42s - 5478.02s] even if they're not feeling it back.
[5478.02s - 5480.94s] Because that's the beautiful thing about love.
[5480.94s - 5484.42s] Love is not only experienced in receiving,
[5484.42s - 5485.86s] it's experienced in giving.
[5485.86s - 5488.50s] That's the most phenomenal thing about love
[5488.50s - 5492.06s] is that when you're giving someone something special,
[5492.06s - 5494.54s] you feel love just as much as they do.
[5494.54s - 5496.46s] Sometimes we feel it even more
[5496.46s - 5498.74s] than when we're receiving something, right?
[5498.74s - 5501.30s] There's this feeling of when you've done something
[5501.30s - 5504.30s] for someone you love, there's a joy in it.

[5504.30s - 5506.42s] You think about it, you said you love gardening.
[5506.42s - 5509.96s] Gardening is the best analogy for this.
[5509.96s - 5512.84s] There is no rose in the world
[5512.84s - 5515.96s] that grows the day you plant the seed.
[5515.96s - 5518.24s] There is no plant in the world
[5518.24s - 5521.67s] that grows the day you plant the seed.
[5521.67s - 5526.67s] It takes months, sometimes even years for a tree
[5527.11s - 5530.31s] to have a beautiful fruit or a beautiful flower.
[5530.31s - 5532.90s] And it takes a particular season.
[5532.90s - 5534.46s] Now, if you planted that seed
[5534.46s - 5537.20s] and said, why don't I have a fruit today?
[5537.20s - 5538.24s] It wouldn't make sense.
[5538.24s - 5540.04s] I'd look at you like you're crazy.
[5540.04s - 5541.72s] But that's what we do in love.
[5541.72s - 5543.60s] We plant the seed today
[5543.60s - 5548.10s] and we want the fruit, the flower and the shade today.

[5548.10s - 5550.38s] And the deepest form of love
[5550.38s - 5552.64s] is something that Emerson said,
[5552.64s - 5557.48s] plant trees under whose shade you do not plan to sit.
[5557.48s - 5559.13s] And that's what you do.
[5559.13s - 5560.89s] You are helping so many people
[5560.89s - 5563.15s] that you probably don't even know.
[5563.15s - 5565.35s] Hopefully they'll get to meet you one day and tell you,
[5565.35s - 5567.19s] Mal, I really hope that you get to hear it.
[5567.19s - 5569.27s] But there'll be so many people who never do.
[5569.27s - 5570.39s] But you're not doing it for that.
[5570.39s - 5572.19s] You're doing it because you're happy
[5572.19s - 5573.91s] for trees to just exist
[5573.91s - 5577.71s] so that other people can get fruits and flowers and shade.
[5577.71s - 5580.87s] So let's not sit here and plant the seed today
[5580.87s - 5583.53s] and expect to eat the fruit today.
[5583.53s - 5585.61s] It doesn't work that way.

[5585.61s - 5587.77s] Plant the seed and keep planting the seeds.
[5587.77s - 5590.99s] And you will find decades from now.
[5590.99s - 5593.51s] There'll be someone who comes to you 25 years from now
[5593.51s - 5595.67s] and says, you did this one thing.
[5595.67s - 5597.75s] I love calling my teachers.
[5597.75s - 5598.87s] I love calling all teachers.
[5598.87s - 5601.23s] I'm really good friends with all the schools I went to.
[5601.23s - 5603.63s] I love calling professors, teachers,
[5603.63s - 5605.43s] talking about them in interviews,
[5605.43s - 5607.07s] making them feel really embarrassed
[5607.07s - 5608.91s] and just saying how much they changed my life
[5608.91s - 5610.43s] and how much I love them.
[5610.43s - 5613.51s] Because I don't think they knew that then.
[5613.51s - 5615.55s] At that time, I was just a teenager
[5615.55s - 5618.63s] who had teenage issues and didn't care about teachers
[5618.63s - 5620.95s] and probably, you know, whatever, I was just a kid.

[5620.95s - 5622.19s] Now when I look back, I'm like,
[5622.19s - 5623.35s] that teacher changed my life.
[5623.35s - 5624.99s] Let me tell them.
[5624.99s - 5628.54s] And that's a seed that they planted all those years ago.
[5628.54s - 5629.50s] So live for that.
[5629.50s - 5630.66s] You know, let's live for that.
[5630.66s - 5634.08s] Let's not live for this instant immediate love.
[5634.08s - 5636.28s] Who is a teacher from when you're a little?
[5636.28s - 5637.48s] Oh gosh, there's a couple.
[5637.48s - 5640.92s] So there's two that come to mind as soon as you say that.
[5640.92s - 5644.64s] One is Mr. Buckeridge, who was my art teacher.
[5644.64s - 5647.20s] And I loved art at school.
[5647.20s - 5649.52s] And actually when I was 11 years old,
[5649.52s - 5651.36s] my favorite subject was math
[5651.36s - 5653.44s] and my least favorite subject was art.
[5653.44s - 5655.12s] And when I went to high school,
[5655.12s - 5656.56s] my favorite subject was art

[5656.56s - 5658.36s] and my least favorite subject was math.
[5658.36s - 5660.44s] And art I fell in love with because of this teacher.
[5660.44s - 5662.16s] There was something beautifully taught me
[5662.16s - 5664.51s] and I really owe this to him.
[5664.51s - 5667.23s] Every time I presented a piece of work,
[5667.23s - 5670.29s] he'd say to me, why did you do it?
[5670.29s - 5672.57s] And at that time, I didn't have an answer.
[5672.57s - 5674.21s] I just did it because it looked good.
[5674.21s - 5675.41s] It looked cool.
[5675.41s - 5677.17s] My answer was that basic.
[5677.17s - 5678.49s] Yeah, they look good together.
[5678.49s - 5679.81s] The colors match.
[5679.81s - 5680.69s] Oh, this looks cool.
[5680.69s - 5682.05s] It looks trendy.
[5682.05s - 5683.45s] And he'd never be satisfied with that.
[5683.45s - 5685.09s] He'd say, why did you do it?
[5685.09s - 5686.41s] And he kept asking me that.
[5686.41s - 5688.17s] And in the beginning, it would annoy me.

[5688.17s - 5689.49s] It would annoy me so much.
[5689.49s - 5691.49s] It'd be like, God, come on, it looks good.
[5691.49s - 5692.33s] Who cares?
[5692.33s - 5693.17s] Just give me an A.
[5693.17s - 5694.01s] Like you like the look of it.
[5694.01s - 5695.49s] He loved how it looked.
[5695.49s - 5697.69s] But he wasn't satisfied with that.
[5697.69s - 5699.18s] Say why?
[5699.18s - 5702.74s] I believe he's the reason I became such an intentional person
[5702.74s - 5707.90s] because he didn't allow me to place one color or dot or shape
[5707.90s - 5711.02s] next to something else if I could not explain why.
[5711.02s - 5713.94s] So today, if you come to my home, you come to my space,
[5713.94s - 5717.82s] everything from the moment I wake up to what I see
[5717.82s - 5720.06s] to which book is by my bedside,
[5720.06s - 5722.66s] to what quote is next to my work desk,
[5722.66s - 5725.98s] everything is meticulously intentionally planned out

[5725.98s - 5728.30s] because he never allowed me space
[5728.30s - 5731.05s] to just do something because it looked good.
[5731.05s - 5733.41s] And that is the biggest gift he's given me
[5733.41s - 5735.97s] because my life is so intentional.
[5735.97s - 5736.81s] And he gave me that.
[5736.81s - 5737.65s] He was an art teacher.
[5737.65s - 5741.17s] I didn't know that at 11 to 18 when he was my teacher,
[5741.17s - 5743.21s] but I look back and I know it now.
[5743.21s - 5746.05s] Oh my God, you're making me think of a teacher
[5746.05s - 5748.57s] that I wish was to with us.
[5748.57s - 5752.73s] He was my middle school and high school math teacher.
[5752.73s - 5754.57s] I loved math.
[5754.57s - 5757.61s] Mr. Gourg, Glenn Gourg, he was a military guy.
[5757.61s - 5759.49s] So he had a crew cut and he always wore those
[5759.49s - 5762.09s] like short sleeve collared shirts
[5762.09s - 5764.45s] and he had the protector and the glasses
[5764.45s - 5765.33s] and the whole thing.

[5765.33s - 5767.49s] And God, did I love math?
[5767.49s - 5770.29s] And he would always call people up
[5770.29s - 5772.53s] to solve problems on the chalkboard.
[5772.53s - 5777.37s] And I can feel him like handing the chalk to me, right?
[5777.37s - 5779.25s] And so he would like solve the chalk things
[5779.25s - 5780.57s] and then he'd coach it through it.
[5780.57s - 5781.93s] And then we'd talk about the problems
[5781.93s - 5784.09s] but he had this thing that he would do
[5784.09s - 5787.13s] where if somebody started to struggle
[5787.17s - 5789.49s] or get frustrated or feel really stupid,
[5789.49s - 5794.04s] he would turn to the class and say, what do I always say?
[5794.04s - 5798.76s] And we would all recite back her severance wins
[5798.76s - 5800.88s] and he would take his chalk and he would write
[5800.88s - 5804.40s] in all caps, her severance wins.
[5804.40s - 5805.64s] And they would underline it.

[5805.64s - 5808.52s] And they would be like exclamation, exclamation.
[5808.52s - 5810.48s] And it's true.
[5810.48s - 5812.84s] It like seeped into my pores
[5812.84s - 5816.21s] and I think more than anything else
[5816.25s - 5819.85s] that I yes planted seeds,
[5819.85s - 5823.65s] but just kept going.
[5823.65s - 5828.65s] That per severance wins part of just don't quit.
[5829.05s - 5831.25s] Like that's part of it is just you're always,
[5831.25s - 5835.94s] if you open yourself up to learning,
[5835.94s - 5839.50s] to experimenting, to all of the abundance
[5839.50s - 5841.82s] that is available to you out there.
[5841.82s - 5843.50s] Eventually it comes.
[5843.50s - 5844.46s] I love that.
[5844.46s - 5845.30s] I love that.
[5845.30s - 5846.22s] You know, everyone should do that.
[5846.22s - 5848.94s] Everyone should reach out to a teacher, if they can,
[5848.94s - 5850.42s] if that person's still alive.
[5850.42s - 5852.06s] And just tell them, send them an email,

[5852.06s - 5855.34s] drop them a Facebook message, DM or whatever access,
[5855.34s - 5856.54s] call the school if you have to.
[5856.54s - 5860.10s] Like it will just, it creates that energy in our life
[5860.10s - 5863.06s] of gratitude and valuing people and appreciation.
[5863.06s - 5864.06s] And it will come back.
[5864.06s - 5865.38s] It promise you will come back.
[5865.38s - 5867.74s] You could share this episode, this conversation
[5867.74s - 5870.42s] with people that you care about and tell them
[5870.42s - 5875.42s] how much this conversation made you think of them
[5875.42s - 5877.82s] and realize how much you love them.
[5877.82s - 5879.42s] Like, what a beautiful thing.
[5879.42s - 5881.26s] You know another beautiful thing, Jay?
[5881.26s - 5884.14s] Is that I know that as you're listening
[5884.14s - 5886.70s] and as you've spent all this time together with Jay
[5886.70s - 5890.58s] and I today, you're thinking, God, I wish I could meet Jay.

[5890.58s - 5892.26s] And you're going on tour.
[5892.26s - 5894.18s] I am so excited.
[5894.18s - 5895.02s] Tell me about it.
[5895.02s - 5896.10s] I have never, ever.
[5896.10s - 5897.98s] So I went on a World Tour two years ago.
[5897.98s - 5898.86s] But that was for a book.
[5898.86s - 5899.70s] But that was for a book.
[5899.70s - 5900.54s] Right.
[5900.54s - 5903.54s] This is the first time ever
[5903.54s - 5907.98s] that we're taking the on purpose podcast on tour.
[5907.98s - 5910.62s] And I promise you, the insights that we're going to share,
[5910.62s - 5912.86s] the wisdom that's going to be shared on this tour
[5912.86s - 5916.74s] has not been shared in any book on any podcast.
[5916.74s - 5918.22s] It's so fresh.
[5918.22s - 5920.38s] And you're going to get to see the best part about it
[5920.38s - 5922.78s] is you're going to get to see me and my friends,
[5922.78s - 5925.38s] people that I know deeply on stage,

[5925.38s - 5929.65s] 15 guests in 15 cities, different guests,
[5929.65s - 5931.77s] just have a real conversation like this.
[5931.77s - 5933.61s] And the best part for your audience
[5933.61s - 5938.25s] is you have kindly agreed in the craziest schedule
[5938.25s - 5942.41s] of all time to be my guest in Boston.
[5942.41s - 5943.05s] That's right.
[5943.05s - 5944.17s] Wang Theater.
[5944.17s - 5945.89s] Right now, the Wang Theater.
[5945.89s - 5948.57s] You better get tickets because they're going to be gone.
[5948.57s - 5950.37s] Like they're probably already gone by the time of year.
[5950.37s - 5951.77s] Yeah, it's amazing.
[5951.77s - 5954.41s] So jshaddy.me forward slash tour.
[5954.41s - 5958.25s] We're doing 15 cities across North America to start.
[5958.25s - 5959.41s] You're so excited about it.
[5959.41s - 5962.81s] Well, I am because now, you know,
[5962.81s - 5966.82s] having this incredible podcast,

[5966.82s - 5971.90s] there's an intimacy that you have with your listeners
[5971.90s - 5974.50s] because we know that everyone who's listening right now
[5974.50s - 5979.85s] listens every day, every week, all year round.
[5979.97s - 5984.06s] The connection I feel to my on purpose community
[5984.06s - 5988.06s] is so deep because it's all year round.
[5988.06s - 5990.74s] It's not the same as anything else.
[5990.74s - 5995.78s] We're in people's ears every single day, every single week.
[5995.98s - 5998.86s] Now, imagine this person's usually on a hike.
[5998.86s - 6000.46s] All of you that are listening, you're on a hike,
[6000.46s - 6003.54s] you're cooking, you're in the car commuting to work,
[6003.54s - 6005.18s] you're maybe at work, you're at the gym,
[6005.18s - 6007.14s] you're walking your dog.
[6007.14s - 6011.82s] Now we get to be in the same place at the same time
[6011.82s - 6014.46s] in person and on top of that,

[6014.46s - 6018.90s] you're now surrounded by people who do the same thing as you.
[6018.94s - 6023.26s] So my favorite thing is not even just what we're going to do on stage.
[6023.26s - 6026.26s] It's the fact that people are going to walk out there as friends.
[6026.26s - 6029.18s] People are going to walk out there connected to people
[6029.18s - 6030.58s] that they've maybe never met.
[6030.58s - 6034.02s] I think people are going to walk out there with a future wife or husband or partner
[6034.02s - 6036.58s] because that person is doing the same thing you're doing.
[6036.58s - 6041.28s] The collective consciousness of a space like that
[6041.28s - 6042.48s] is unheard of.
[6042.48s - 6046.28s] There's very few places that people gather today
[6046.28s - 6050.52s] with the same exact intention in person.
[6050.52s - 6053.24s] It used to be there, it doesn't exist anymore.
[6053.24s - 6055.80s] You go to a coffee shop, everyone's there for different reasons.

[6055.80s - 6058.32s] Someone's working, someone's wasting some time,
[6058.32s - 6060.92s] someone's starting their day, someone's ending their day.
[6060.92s - 6063.48s] There's not a collective consciousness.
[6063.48s - 6065.44s] You go to an office, some people working from home,
[6065.44s - 6068.08s] some people work from there, some people are there to pay the bills,
[6068.08s - 6072.46s] some people are there because they're excited, different consciousness.
[6072.46s - 6077.06s] Everyone who listens to the Mel Robbins podcast or to on purpose
[6077.06s - 6080.78s] is committed to learning, listening and growing
[6080.78s - 6085.53s] and committed to health, happiness and healing.
[6085.53s - 6090.67s] The energy in that room, there's no other place you can go to that feels that way.
[6090.67s - 6092.76s] It doesn't exist.
[6092.76s - 6093.92s] It's really, really special.
[6093.92s - 6095.92s] That's why I'm so excited because

[6095.92s - 6098.76s] collective consciousness doesn't work like that anymore.
[6098.76s - 6102.84s] In the past, there's something beautiful that I'm writing about for my next book.
[6102.84s - 6105.40s] It's called the Third Space Theory.
[6105.40s - 6115.78s] This idea that a few decades ago, we all had three spaces that we lived in.
[6115.78s - 6121.30s] One was home, one was work, and one was church.
[6121.30s - 6125.86s] There was a place that you called home where you felt very safe and comfortable.
[6125.86s - 6130.46s] There was a place that you called work, which was very productive and effective.
[6130.46s - 6135.46s] And then there was a place that gave you the vision to reflect back
[6135.46s - 6140.03s] on who you were at home and who you were at work and how you could be better.
[6140.03s - 6144.59s] Slowly as time went on, that third space disappeared.
[6144.59s - 6149.54s] So we had home and we had work because of the pandemic.
[6149.54s - 6151.06s] Work disappeared.

[6151.06s - 6153.13s] So now we only have home.
[6153.13s - 6155.65s] So at home, we eat where we're meant to sleep.
[6155.65s - 6159.61s] We sleep where we're meant to work and we work where we're meant to eat.
[6159.61s - 6165.81s] The energy of home has become so complicated that we don't know how to find a productive
[6165.81s - 6171.45s] energy, how to find a connected energy, how to find a safe calm energy.
[6171.45s - 6175.75s] We've lost that podcast of the new third space.
[6175.75s - 6177.43s] That's where people are gathering.
[6177.43s - 6181.95s] But what if we can turn that into a place, a physical space where you can gather, where
[6181.95s - 6186.55s] people come to listen, learn, to reflect back on their life, to want to be better, to support
[6186.55s - 6187.91s] each other.
[6187.91s - 6190.59s] And so there's such a need for us to do these things.
[6190.59s - 6193.11s] And I'm so glad you're on going on tour.
[6193.11s - 6195.11s] We can come and see you as well.

[6195.11s - 6197.48s] It's just, it's so needed right now.
[6197.48s - 6200.04s] I love how you just laid that out.
[6200.04s - 6201.24s] It's true.
[6201.24s - 6203.80s] It's like the three legs of the stool, two of them are gone.
[6203.80s - 6207.84s] That's why everybody's so wobbly and trying to find their balance.
[6207.84s - 6212.96s] And you know, I'm also excited because when you have these conversations, I always think
[6212.96s - 6220.14s] about that I'm taking a walk with you as you're listening and that today we have invited
[6220.14s - 6227.22s] my dear friend, Jay Shetty, on this metaphorical walk together on the road of life.
[6227.22s - 6233.34s] And you know, I was curious, Jay, you've shared so much, you've poured into us with such just
[6233.34s - 6235.06s] grace and wisdom.
[6235.06s - 6242.70s] And you know, I knew this was going to be extraordinary.
[6242.70s - 6253.99s] I am just blown away by the impact that this will make in the person's life who's listening,

[6253.99s - 6260.55s] the impact it's made in my life, how it has truly brought us closer.
[6260.55s - 6266.01s] I'm so excited for all the things that you're working on.
[6266.01s - 6274.13s] If there was one thing that you want the person who's listening to do, just one thing, the
[6274.13s - 6281.45s] most important thing to really focus on coming out of just how generous you have been
[6281.45s - 6284.74s] with all of us.
[6284.74s - 6288.74s] What is the one thing today?
[6288.74s - 6298.23s] The one thing is, if you're feeling stuck, I want you to ask yourself one question.
[6298.23s - 6306.27s] Life can either be a school, a hospital, a movie, or a mountain.
[6306.27s - 6308.19s] Ask yourself.
[6308.19s - 6312.88s] If life feels like a school right now, what do I need to learn?
[6312.88s - 6317.26s] Because the same lessons will keep repeating until we learn them.
[6317.26s - 6322.82s] If you're feeling like you're caught in a spiral of the same thing after the same thing,

[6322.82s - 6325.44s] life is trying to teach you something.
[6325.44s - 6328.92s] Go to the school of life.
[6328.92s - 6332.82s] Sometimes life feels like a hospital, there's something to heal.
[6332.82s - 6338.76s] If you feel in pain, if you feel held back, if you feel like you're not strong enough
[6338.76s - 6343.80s] yet to go out there and go after something, ask yourself, what do I need to heal and
[6343.80s - 6346.18s] start healing?
[6346.18s - 6347.98s] Sometimes life feels like a movie.
[6347.98s - 6351.18s] Everything's kind of going in a great direction.
[6351.18s - 6354.34s] Pause and ask yourself, what do I need to experience?
[6354.34s - 6356.90s] Because this experience will also dissipate and disappear.
[6356.90s - 6360.46s] Let me really experience it.
[6360.46s - 6366.14s] And finally, for those who are already on their path, life can feel like a mountain.
[6366.14s - 6368.58s] Ask yourself, what do I need to climb?

[6368.58s - 6371.26s] What skill do I need to learn to climb better?
[6371.26s - 6376.62s] You're stuck because you haven't figured out whether life is a school, a hospital,
[6376.62s - 6379.02s] a movie, or a mountain.
[6379.02s - 6383.62s] And as soon as you see the patterns, are you being questioned again and again to learn
[6383.62s - 6384.62s] something?
[6384.62s - 6387.26s] Are you being challenged again and again to learn something?
[6387.26s - 6392.43s] Are you just feeling so much pain that you can't even bear the burden to move forward?
[6392.43s - 6395.21s] Then it's all about healing.
[6395.21s - 6397.21s] Are you living at the top of the world?
[6397.21s - 6399.85s] But time feels like it's moving too fast.
[6399.85s - 6402.05s] You're immersed in that experience.
[6402.05s - 6408.35s] And if you're building right now, build that skill so you can climb higher and faster.

[6408.35s - 6413.62s] You know, as you're listening, I want to point out something that just happened.
[6413.62s - 6417.26s] You probably saw it if you're watching on YouTube.
[6417.26s - 6423.70s] As Jay just shared that with you, what has been a wildly dreary and ugly day here in Boston
[6423.70s - 6433.60s] shifted and sunlight came streaming in and lit you up like a spotlight from above.
[6433.60s - 6436.65s] Did you feel that?
[6436.65s - 6437.65s] You know what?
[6437.65s - 6438.65s] You're more present than I am.
[6438.65s - 6439.85s] I was so locked in.
[6439.85s - 6444.33s] I didn't feel it until you said it and I looked over and I'm like, wow, it shows how
[6444.33s - 6445.33s] present you are.
[6445.33s - 6446.33s] That's beautiful.
[6446.33s - 6447.33s] I love that.
[6447.33s - 6448.33s] Well, I took the...
[6448.33s - 6452.93s] I was hanging on every word and I realized I'm in the movie and I really want to be present
[6452.93s - 6455.34s] and experience it.

[6455.34s - 6458.80s] Jay Shetty, what are your parting words, my friend?
[6458.80s - 6461.69s] My parting words, I'm so grateful to you, Mal.
[6461.69s - 6468.89s] You know, I'm so grateful to you because you've just done this for so many years and given
[6468.89s - 6474.93s] your heart and you are receiving everything that you deserve, everything that you're getting
[6474.93s - 6476.89s] you deserve so deeply.
[6476.89s - 6484.37s] And it is so beautiful to witness your friends being honored and being adored and being loved
[6484.37s - 6495.87s] because there's a sense that I know we both always have that to shift the world, it's
[6495.87s - 6497.31s] going to take a lot of us.
[6497.31s - 6502.35s] I'm going to have to work together and what I love about you is that you are always spotlight
[6502.35s - 6503.35s] in your friends.
[6503.35s - 6504.55s] You're always showing up for your friends.

[6504.55s - 6510.07s] You're always supporting your friends behind the scenes and on camera and I'm just so grateful
[6510.07s - 6511.43s] that you made time for me today.
[6511.43s - 6516.92s] I always say to people, my public life is amazing but my private life is better and my private
[6516.92s - 6522.89s] life is better because of people like you because we get to have genuine relationships
[6522.89s - 6528.97s] and see a deep real relationships for years offline and they support everything online.
[6528.97s - 6532.93s] If someone's online life is better than their offline life, that's a really hard place to
[6532.93s - 6538.21s] live and I'm so grateful that because of friends like you, I get to say the opposite.
[6538.21s - 6545.89s] Well, Jay, I think when things feel dark, the job in life is to glow and you've definitely
[6545.89s - 6547.91s] taught me how to do that.
[6547.91s - 6548.91s] Thank you.
[6548.91s - 6551.95s] I want to give you a big hug too.

[6551.95s - 6552.95s] I love you.
[6552.95s - 6553.95s] I love you too.
[6553.95s - 6554.95s] Really, really love you.
[6554.95s - 6555.95s] Yeah.
[6555.95s - 6561.14s] And thank you to all of you as well, like just all of you that are listening and watching
[6561.14s - 6565.16s] right now, you're already on the path.
[6565.16s - 6568.72s] The fact that you're listening to Mel, this is the path.
[6568.72s - 6570.44s] You don't have to start something new.
[6570.44s - 6572.16s] You don't have to suddenly figure it out.
[6572.16s - 6573.32s] You are figuring it out.
[6573.32s - 6574.72s] That's why you're here.
[6574.72s - 6581.20s] So please feel encouraged and fueled and connected knowing that you've already committed.
[6581.20s - 6583.24s] You're already showing up for yourself.
[6583.24s - 6584.84s] You've already invested in yourself.
[6584.84s - 6589.32s] The fact that you're here proves that you're already living the world that you want to
[6589.32s - 6590.32s] live in.

[6590.32s - 6593.12s] So don't feel like you've got to start something, figure it out, that you're stuck.
[6593.12s - 6594.12s] You're already not stuck.
[6594.12s - 6595.12s] You're already moving.
[6595.12s - 6596.76s] If you're stuck, you wouldn't be here.
[6596.76s - 6600.48s] See that as building momentum and keep showing up.
[6600.48s - 6601.72s] Jay, thank you.
[6601.72s - 6602.72s] Thank you.
[6602.72s - 6603.72s] Thank you.
[6603.72s - 6607.40s] Thank you for listening and watching all the way to the end.
[6607.40s - 6612.22s] And what I'm really excited about is I agree with you, Jay, that you're already moving
[6612.22s - 6613.74s] into the right direction.
[6613.74s - 6619.90s] And everything that Jay poured into you and into me today as the sun is even getting brighter
[6619.90s - 6626.78s] in here in our studios in Boston is how you turn on that switch and you actually tap into

[6626.78s - 6632.62s] not only the light that's inside you, but you also, we talked a lot about receiving.
[6632.62s - 6636.26s] That is a skill that I had to learn.
[6636.26s - 6642.18s] And when you focus on noticing what's around you and allowing it in, you will feel more
[6642.18s - 6643.18s] loved.
[6643.18s - 6644.94s] You will feel better.
[6644.94s - 6646.46s] I just so believe that.
[6646.46s - 6650.98s] And I wanted to tell you, in case no one else does, that I love you and I believe in
[6650.98s - 6653.78s] you and I believe in your ability to create a better life.
[6653.78s - 6659.10s] And there is no doubt in my mind that based on everything that Jay just poured into you,
[6659.10s - 6660.10s] you actually will.
[6660.10s - 6661.23s] All righty.
[6661.23s - 6662.23s] I'll see you in a few days.
[6662.23s - 6666.67s] I'll be waiting to welcome you in to the very next episode, the moment you hit play.
[6666.67s - 6667.67s] I'll see you there.

[6667.67s - 6670.79s] You're definitely going to love this one and I'm going to be waiting to welcome you into
[6670.79s - 6671.79s] it.
[6671.79s - 6672.63s] The moment you hit play, I'll see you there.
